Merkel cell
Merkel cells, also known as Merkel–Ranvier cells or tactile
epithelial cells, are oval-shaped mechanoreceptors essential for
light touch sensation and found in the skin of vertebrates. They
are abundant in highly sensitive skin like that of the fingertips in
humans, and make synaptic contacts with somatosensory
afferent nerve fibers. It has been reported that Merkel cells are
derived from neural crest cells, though more recent experiments
in mammals have indicated that they are epithelial in origin.
Merkel cells are found in the skin and some parts of the mucosa
of all vertebrates. In mammalian skin, they are clear cells found
in the stratum basale[1][2] (at the bottom of sweat duct ridges)
of the epidermis approximately 10  μm in diameter. They are
oval-shaped mechanoreceptors essential for light touch
sensation and found in the skin of vertebrates. They are
abundant in highly sensitive skin like that of the fingertips in
humans, and make synaptic contacts with somatosensory
afferent nerve fibers.[3] They also occur in epidermal
invaginations of the plantar foot surface called rete ridges.[4]
Most often, they are associated with sensory nerve endings,
when they are known as Merkel nerve endings (also called a
Merkel cell-neurite complex). They are associated with slowly
adapting (SA1) somatosensory nerve fibers. They react to low
vibrations (5–15 Hz) and deep static touch such as shapes and
edges. Due to a small receptive field (extremely detailed info) they
are densely present in areas like fingertips; they are not covered
(shelled) and thus respond to pressures over long periods.
The origin of Merkel cells has been debated for over 20 years.
Evidence from skin graft experiments in birds implies that they are
neural crest derived,[5] but experiments in mammals now
demonstrate an epidermal origin.[6][7]

Function
The German anatomist Friedrich Sigmund Merkel referred to Merkel cells as Tastzellen or "touch cells".
Until recently this proposed function was controversial and hard to prove, due to the close physical
association of Merkel cells with sensory nerve endings. However, recent work in mice and other model
organisms demonstrates that Merkel cells intrinsically transform touch into electrical signals that are
transmitted to the nervous system.[8] Merkel cells express PIEZO2, a mechanosensitive ion channel that
responds to mechanical forces. Mice in which Piezo2 is knocked-out specifically in skin cells, but not
sensory neurons, show decreased behavioral responses to gentle touch.[9]
Merkel cells are sometimes considered APUD cells (an older definition, more commonly classified as a part
of dispersed neuroendocrine system) because they contain dense core granules, and thus may also have a
neuroendocrine function.[10]
Although uncommon, these cells may become malignant and form a Merkel cell carcinoma—an aggressive
and difficult to treat skin cancer.[11][12]
