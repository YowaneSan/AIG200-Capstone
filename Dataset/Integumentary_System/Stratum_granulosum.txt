Stratum granulosum
The stratum granulosum (or granular layer) is a thin layer of
cells in the epidermis lying above the stratum spinosum and below
the stratum corneum (stratum lucidum on the soles and palms).[1]
Keratinocytes migrating from the underlying stratum spinosum
become known as granular cells in this layer. These cells contain
keratohyalin granules, which are filled with histidine- and cysteine-
rich proteins that appear to bind the keratin filaments together.
Therefore, the main function of keratohyalin granules is to bind
intermediate keratin filaments together.[2][3]
At the transition between this layer and the stratum corneum, cells
secrete lamellar bodies (containing lipids and proteins) into the
extracellular space. This results in the formation of the hydrophobic
lipid envelope responsible for the skin's barrier properties.
Concomitantly, cells lose their nuclei and organelles.
