Stratum basale
The stratum basale (basal layer, sometimes referred to as stratum
germinativum) is the deepest layer of the five layers of the
epidermis, the external covering of skin in mammals.
The stratum basale is a single layer of columnar or cuboidal basal
cells. The cells are attached to each other and to the overlying
stratum spinosum cells by desmosomes and hemidesmosomes. The
nucleus is large, ovoid and occupies most of the cell. Some basal
cells can act like stem cells with the ability to divide and produce
new cells, and these are sometimes called basal keratinocyte stem
cells. Others serve to anchor the epidermis glabrous skin (hairless),
and hyper-proliferative epidermis (from a skin disease).[1]
They divide to form the keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum,
which migrate superficially.[2] Other types of cells found within the
stratum basale are melanocytes (pigment-producing cells) and
Merkel cells (touch receptors).
Basal-cell carcinomas (basal-cell cancers), account for around 80
per cent of all skin cancers.[3] Not all basal-cell cancers originate in the basal cells but they are so named
because the cancer cells resemble basal cells when seen under a microscope.[4]
Clinical significance
In a growing fetus, fingerprints form where the cells of the stratum basale meet the papillae of the
underlying dermal layer (papillary layer), resulting in the formation of the ridges on the fingers. Fingerprints
are unique to each individual and are used for forensic analyses because the patterns do not change with the
growth and aging processes.[5]
