Hair
Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the
dermis. Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals.
The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered
in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair.
Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair
types, and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial
primarily composed of protein, notably alpha-keratin.
Attitudes towards different forms of hair, such as hairstyles and
hair removal, vary widely across different cultures and
historical periods, but it is often used to indicate a person's
personal beliefs or social position, such as their age, gender, or
religion.[1]
The word "hair" usually refers to two distinct structures:
1. the part beneath the skin, called the hair follicle, or,
when pulled from the skin, the bulb or root. This
organ is located in the dermis and maintains stem
cells, which not only re-grow the hair after it falls out,
but also are recruited to regrow skin after a wound.[2]
2. the hair shaft, which is the hard filamentous part that
extends above the skin surface. A cross section of the
hair shaft may be divided roughly into three zones.
Hair fibers have a structure consisting of several layers, starting
from the outside:
1. the cuticle, which consists of several layers of flat,
thin cells laid out overlapping one another as roof
shingles
2. the cortex, which contains the keratin bundles in cell
structures that remain roughly rod-like
3. the medulla, a disorganized and open area at the
fiber's center[3]
Each strand of hair is made up of the medulla, cortex, and
cuticle.[4] The innermost region, the medulla, is an open and
unstructured region which is not always present.[5] The highly
structural and organized cortex, or second of three layers of the

Anatomy of the hair shaft and bulb.
Hair follicle of Felidae.
Root of the hair
hair, is the primary source of mechanical strength and water
uptake. The cortex contains melanin, which colors the fiber
based on the number, distribution and types of melanin
granules. The melanin may be evenly spaced or cluster around
the edges of the hair.[6] The shape of the follicle determines the
shape of the cortex, and the shape of the fiber is related to how
straight or curly the hair is. People with straight hair have round
hair fibers. Oval and other shaped fibers are generally more
wavy or curly. The cuticle is the outer covering. Its complex
structure slides as the hair swells and is covered with a single
molecular layer of lipid that makes the hair repel water.[4] The
diameter of human hair varies from 0.017 to 0.18 millimeters
(0.00067 to 0.00709  in).[7] Some of these characteristics in
humans' head hair vary by race: people of mostly African
ancestry tend to have hair with a diameter of 60-90 μm and a
flat cross-section, while people of mostly European or Middle
Eastern ancestry tend to have hair with a diameter of 70-100
μm and an oval cross-section, and people of mostly Asian or
Native American ancestry tend to have hair with a diameter of
90-120 μm and a round cross-section.[6] There are roughly two
million small, tubular glands and sweat glands that produce watery
fluids that cool the body by evaporation. The glands at the opening
of the hair produce a fatty secretion that lubricates the hair.[8]
Hair growth begins inside the hair follicle. The only "living"
portion of the hair is found in the follicle. The hair that is visible is
the hair shaft, which exhibits no biochemical activity and is
considered "dead". The base of a hair's root (the "bulb") contains
the cells that produce the hair shaft.[9] Other structures of the hair
follicle include the oil producing sebaceous gland which lubricates
the hair and the arrector pili muscles, which are responsible for
causing hairs to stand up. In humans with little body hair, the effect
results in goose bumps.
The root of the hair ends in an enlargement, the hair bulb, which is
whiter in color and softer in texture than the shaft and is lodged in a
follicular involution of the epidermis called the hair follicle. The
bulb of hair consists of fibrous connective tissue, glassy membrane,
external root sheath, internal root sheath composed of epithelium
stratum (Henle's layer) and granular stratum (Huxley's layer),
cuticle, cortex and medulla.[10]

All natural hair colors are the result of two types of hair
pigments. Both of these pigments are melanin types, produced
inside the hair follicle and packed into granules found in the
fibers. Eumelanin is the dominant pigment in brown hair and
black hair, while pheomelanin is dominant in red hair. Blond
hair is the result of having little pigmentation in the hair strand.
Gray hair occurs when melanin production decreases or stops,
while poliosis is white hair (and often the skin to which the hair
is attached), typically in spots that never possessed melanin at
all, or ceased for natural reasons, generally genetic, in the first
years of life.
Hair grows everywhere on the external body except for mucus
membranes and glabrous skin, such as that found on the palms
of the hands, soles of the feet, and lips.
The body has different types of hair, including vellus hair and
androgenic hair, each with its own type of cellular construction.
The different construction gives the hair unique characteristics,
serving specific purposes, mainly, warmth and protection.
The three stages of hair growth are the anagen, catagen, and
telogen phases. Each strand of hair on the human body is at its
own stage of development. Once the cycle is complete, it
restarts and a new strand of hair begins to form. The growth
rate of hair varies from individual to individual depending on
their age, genetic predisposition and a number of environmental
factors.[11] It is commonly stated that hair grows about 1 cm per
month on average; however reality is more complex, since not
all hair grows at once. Scalp hair was reported to grow between
0.6 cm and 3.36 cm per month. The growth rate of scalp hair
somewhat depends on age (hair tends to grow more slowly
with age), sex, and ethnicity.[12] Thicker hair (>60 μm) grows
generally faster (11.4 mm per month) than thinner (20-30 μm)
hair (7.6 mm per month).[13][14]
It was previously thought that Caucasian hair grew more quickly than Asian hair and that the growth rate of
women's hair was faster than that of men.[12] However, more recent research has shown that the growth
rate of hair in men and women does not significantly differ[15] and that the hair of Chinese people grew
more quickly than the hair of French Caucasians and West and Central Africans.[16] The quantity of hair
hovers in a certain range depending on hair colour.[17][18] An average blonde person has 150,000 hairs, a
brown-haired person has 110,000, a black-haired person has 100,000, and a redhead has 90,000.[19] Hair
growth stops after a human's death. Visible growth of hair on the dead body happens only because of skin
drying out due to water loss.[20][21]
Human hair growth
Human hair contains melanin which
provides dark coloration and
protection from UV radiation. Human
hair can absorb and emit light across
a wide range of wavelengths. The

Hair-follicle cycling
The world record for longest hair on a living person stands with
Smita Srivastava of Uttar Pradesh, India. At 7 feet and 9 inches
long, she broke a Guinness World Record in November 2023,
having grown her hair for 32 years.[22]
Hair exists in a variety of textures. Three main aspects of hair
texture are the curl pattern, volume, and consistency. All
mammalian hair is composed of keratin, so the make-up of hair
follicles is not the source of varying hair patterns. There are a range
of theories pertaining to the curl patterns of hair. Scientists have
come to believe that the shape of the hair shaft has an effect on the
curliness of the individual's hair. A very round shaft allows for
fewer disulfide bonds to be present in the hair strand. This means
the bonds present are directly in line with one another, resulting in
straight hair.[23]
The flatter the hair shaft becomes, the curlier hair gets, because the
shape allows more cysteines to become compacted together
resulting in a bent shape that, with every additional disulfide bond,
becomes curlier in form.[23] As the hair follicle shape determines
curl pattern, the hair follicle size determines thickness. While the
circumference of the hair follicle expands, so does the thickness of
the hair follicle. An individual's hair volume, as a result, can be thin,
normal, or thick. The consistency of hair can almost always be
grouped into three categories: fine, medium, and coarse. This trait is
determined by the hair follicle volume and the condition of the
strand.[24] Fine hair has the smallest circumference, coarse hair has
the largest circumference, and medium hair is anywhere between
the other two.[24] Coarse hair has a more open cuticle than thin or
medium hair causing it to be the most porous.[24]
There are various systems that people use to classify their curl
patterns. Being knowledgeable of an individual's hair type is a good
start to knowing how to take care of one's hair. There is not just one
method to discovering one's hair type. Additionally it is possible,
and quite normal to have more than one kind of hair type, for
instance having a mixture of both type 3a & 3b curls.
Andre Walker system
The Andre Walker Hair Typing System is the most widely used
system to classify hair. The system was created by the hairstylist of Oprah Winfrey, Andre Walker.
According to this system there are four types of hair: straight, wavy, curly, kinky.
Texture
Classification systems
Hair grows at different speeds and
different lengths. Its composition
causes different colors and textures,
which influence how long the hair
strands grow.
Marianne Ernst, a German "Long hair
model".
Type 1 is straight hair, which reflects the most sheen
and also the most resilient hair of all of the hair types. It is
hard to damage and immensely difficult to curl this hair
texture. Because the sebum easily spreads from the
scalp to the ends without curls or kinks to interrupt its
path, it is the most oily hair texture of all.
Type 2 is wavy hair, whose texture and sheen ranges
somewhere between straight and curly hair. Wavy hair is
also more likely to become frizzy than straight hair. While
type A waves can easily alternate between straight and
curly styles, type B and C Wavy hair is resistant to
styling.
Type 3 is curly hair known to have an S-shape. The curl
pattern may resemble a lowercase "s", uppercase "S", or
sometimes an uppercase "Z" or lowercase "z". Lack of
proper care causes less defined curls.
Type 4 is kinky hair, which features a tightly coiled curl
pattern (or no discernible curl pattern at all) that is often
fragile with a very high density. This type of hair shrinks
when wet and because it has fewer cuticle layers than
other hair types it is more susceptible to damage.

Polar bears use their fur for warmth
and while their skin is black, their
transparent fur appears white and
provides camouflage while hunting
and serves as protection by hiding
cubs in the snow.
Hair is mainly composed of keratin proteins and keratin-associated proteins (KRTAPs). The human genome
encodes 54 different keratin proteins which are present in various amounts in hair. Similarly, humans
encode more than 100 different KRTAPs which crosslink keratins in hair. The content of KRTAPs ranges
from less than 3% in human hair to 30–40% in echidna quill.[25]
Many mammals have fur and other hairs that serve different functions. Hair provides thermal regulation and
camouflage for many animals; for others it provides signals to other animals such as warnings, mating, or
other communicative displays; and for some animals hair provides defensive functions and, rarely, even
offensive protection. Hair also has a sensory function, extending the sense of touch beyond the surface of
the skin. Guard hairs give warnings that may trigger a recoiling reaction.
While humans have developed clothing and other means of keeping
warm, the hair found on the head serves primarily as a source of
heat insulation and cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked
hair) as well as protection from ultra-violet radiation exposure. The
function of hair in other locations is debated. Hats and coats are still
required while doing outdoor activities in cold weather to prevent
frostbite and hypothermia, but the hair on the human body does
help to keep the internal temperature regulated. When the body is
too cold, the arrector pili muscles found attached to hair follicles
stand up, causing the hair in these follicles to do the same. These
hairs then form a heat-trapping layer above the epidermis. This
process is formally called piloerection, derived from the Latin
words 'pilus' ('hair') and 'erectio' ('rising up'), but is more commonly
known as 'having goose bumps' in English.[26] This is more
effective in other mammals whose fur fluffs up to create air pockets between hairs that insulate the body
from the cold. The opposite actions occur when the body is too warm; the arrector muscles make the hair lie
flat on the skin which allows heat to leave.
In some mammals, such as hedgehogs and porcupines, the hairs have been modified into hard spines or
quills. These are covered with thick plates of keratin and serve as protection against predators. Thick hair
such as that of the lion's mane and grizzly bear's fur do offer some protection from physical damages such
as bites and scratches.
Displacement and vibration of hair shafts are detected by hair follicle nerve receptors and nerve receptors
within the skin. Hairs can sense movements of air as well as touch by physical objects and they provide
sensory awareness of the presence of ectoparasites.[27] Some hairs, such as eyelashes, are especially

sensitive to the presence of potentially harmful matter.[28][29][30][31]
The eyebrows provide moderate protection to the eyes from dirt,
sweat and rain. They also play a key role in non-verbal
communication by displaying emotions such as sadness, anger,
surprise and excitement. In many other mammals, they contain
much longer, whisker-like hairs that act as tactile sensors.
The eyelash grows at the edges of the eyelid and protects the eye
from dirt. The eyelash is to humans, camels, horses, ostriches etc.,
what whiskers are to cats; they are used to sense when dirt, dust, or
any other potentially harmful object is too close to the eye.[32] The
eye reflexively closes as a result of this sensation.
Eyebrows and eyelashes do not grow beyond a certain length
(eyelashes are rarely more than 10  mm long). However,
trichomegaly can cause the lashes to grow remarkably long and
prominent (in some cases the upper lashes grow to 15 mm long).
Hair has its origins in the common ancestor of mammals, the
synapsids, about 300 million years ago. It is currently unknown at
what stage the synapsids acquired mammalian characteristics such
as body hair and mammary glands, as the fossils only rarely provide
direct evidence for soft tissues. Skin impression of the belly and lower tail of a pelycosaur, possibly
Haptodus shows the basal synapsid stock bore transverse rows of rectangular scutes, similar to those of a
modern crocodile, so the age of acquirement of hair logically could not have been earlier than ≈299 ma,
based on the current understanding of the animal's phylogeny.[33] An exceptionally well-preserved skull of
Estemmenosuchus, a therapsid from the Upper Permian, shows smooth, hairless skin with what appears to
be glandular depressions,[34] though as a semi-aquatic species it might not have been particularly useful to
determine the integument of terrestrial species. The oldest undisputed known fossils showing unambiguous
imprints of hair are the Callovian (late middle Jurassic) Castorocauda and several contemporary
haramiyidans, both near-mammal cynodonts, giving the age as no later than ≈220 ma based on the modern
phylogenetic understanding of these clades.[35][36][37] More recently, studies on terminal Permian Russian
coprolites may suggest that non-mammalian synapsids from that era had fur.[38] If this is the case, these are
the oldest hair remnants known, showcasing that fur occurred as far back as the latest Paleozoic.
Some modern mammals have a special gland in front of each orbit used to preen the fur, called the harderian
gland. Imprints of this structure are found in the skull of the small early mammals like Morganucodon, but
not in their cynodont ancestors like Thrinaxodon.[39]
The hairs of the fur in modern animals are all connected to nerves, and so the fur also serves as a transmitter
for sensory input. Fur could have evolved from sensory hair (whiskers). The signals from this sensory
apparatus is interpreted in the neocortex, a section of the brain that expanded markedly in animals like
Morganucodon and Hadrocodium.[40] The more advanced therapsids could have had a combination of

naked skin, whiskers, and scutes. A full pelage likely did not evolve until the therapsid-mammal
transition.[41] The more advanced, smaller therapsids could have had a combination of hair and scutes, a
combination still found in some modern mammals, such as rodents and the opossum.[42]
The high interspecific variability of the size, color, and microstructure of hair often enables the identification
of species based on single hair filaments.[43][44]
In varying degrees most mammals have some skin areas without
natural hair. On the human body, glabrous skin is found on the
ventral portion of the fingers, palms, soles of feet and lips, which
are all parts of the body most closely associated with interacting
with the world around us,[45] as are the labia minora and glans
penis.[46] There are four main types of mechanoreceptors in the
glabrous skin of humans: Pacinian corpuscles, Meissner's
corpuscles, Merkel's discs, and Ruffini corpuscles.
The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) has evolved skin
lacking in general, pelagic hair covering, yet has retained long, very
sparsely scattered tactile hairs over its body.[45] Glabrousness is a trait that may be associated with
neoteny.[47]
Primates are relatively hairless compared to other mammals, and
hominini such as chimpanzees, have less dense hair than would be
expected given their body size for a primate.[48] Evolutionary
biologists suggest that the genus Homo arose in East Africa
approximately 2 million years ago.[49] Part of this evolution was the
development of endurance running[50] and venturing out during the
hot times of the day[51] that required efficient thermoregulation
through perspiration. The loss of heat through heat of evaporation by means of sweat glands is aided by air
currents next to the skin surface, which are facilitated by the loss of body hair.[52]
Another factor in human evolution that also occurred in the prehistoric past was a preferential selection for
neoteny, particularly in females. The idea that adult humans exhibit certain neotenous (juvenile) features,
not evinced in the other great apes, is about a century old. Louis Bolk made a long list of such traits,[53] and
Stephen Jay Gould published a short list in Ontogeny and Phylogeny.[54] In addition, paedomorphic

characteristics in women are often acknowledged as desirable by men in developed countries.[55] For
instance, vellus hair is a juvenile characteristic. However, while men develop longer, coarser, thicker, and
darker terminal hair through sexual differentiation, women do not, leaving their vellus hair visible.
Kinky hair is a uniquely human characteristic, as most mammals
have straight hair, including the earliest hominids.[56] Jablonski[52]
asserts head hair was evolutionarily advantageous for pre-humans
to retain because it protected the scalp as they walked upright in the
intense African (equatorial) UV light. While some might argue that,
by this logic, humans should also express hairy shoulders because
these body parts would putatively be exposed to similar conditions,
the protection of the head, the seat of the brain that enabled
humanity to become one of the most successful species on the
planet (and which also is very vulnerable at birth) was arguably a
more urgent issue (axillary hair in the underarms and groin were
also retained as signs of sexual maturity). Sometime during the
gradual process by which Homo erectus began a transition from
furry skin to the naked skin expressed by Homo sapiens, hair
texture putatively gradually changed from straight hair (the
condition of most mammals, including humanity's closest cousins—
chimpanzees) to Afro-textured hair or 'kinky' (i.e. tightly coiled).
This argument assumes that curly hair better impedes the passage of
UV light into the body relative to straight hair (thus curly or coiled
hair would be particularly advantageous for light-skinned hominids
living at the equator).
It is substantiated by Iyengar's findings (1998) that UV light can
enter into straight human hair roots (and thus into the body through
the skin) via the hair shaft. Specifically, the results of that study
suggest that this phenomenon resembles the passage of light
through fiber optic tubes (which do not function as effectively when
kinked or sharply curved or coiled). In this sense, when hominids
(i.e. Homo erectus) were gradually losing their straight body hair
and thereby exposing the initially pale skin underneath their fur to
the sun, straight hair would have been an adaptive liability. By
inverse logic, later, as humans traveled farther from Africa and/or
the equator, straight hair may have (initially) evolved to aid the
entry of UV light into the body during the transition from dark, UV-
protected skin to paler skin.
Jablonski's assertions[52] suggest that the adjective "woolly" in
reference to Afro-hair is a misnomer in connoting the high heat
insulation derivable from the true wool of sheep. Instead, the relatively sparse density of Afro-hair,

combined with its springy coils actually results in an airy, almost sponge-like structure that in turn, Jablonski
argues,[52] more likely facilitates an increase in the circulation of cool air onto the scalp. Further, wet Afro-
hair does not stick to the neck and scalp unless totally drenched and instead tends to retain its basic springy
puffiness because it less easily responds to moisture and sweat than straight hair does. In this sense, the trait
may enhance comfort levels in intense equatorial climates more than straight hair (which, on the other hand,
tends to naturally fall over the ears and neck to a degree that provides slightly enhanced comfort levels in
cold climates relative to tightly coiled hair).
Further, it is notable that the most pervasive expression of this hair texture can be found in sub-Saharan
Africa; a region of the world that abundant genetic and paleo-anthropological evidence suggests, was the
relatively recent (≈200,000-year-old) point of origin for modern humanity. In fact, although genetic findings
(Tishkoff, 2009) suggest that sub-Saharan Africans are the most genetically diverse continental group on
Earth, Afro-textured hair approaches ubiquity in this region. This points to a strong, long-term selective
pressure that, in stark contrast to most other regions of the genomes of sub-Saharan groups, left little room
for genetic variation at the determining loci. Such a pattern, again, does not seem to support human sexual
aesthetics as being the sole or primary cause of this distribution.
A group of studies have recently shown that genetic patterns at the
EDAR locus, a region of the modern human genome that
contributes to hair texture variation among most individuals of East
Asian descent, support the hypothesis that (East Asian) straight hair
likely developed in this branch of the modern human lineage
subsequent to the original expression of tightly coiled natural afro-
hair.[57][58][59] Specifically, the relevant findings indicate that the
EDAR mutation coding for the predominant East Asian 'coarse' or thick, straight hair texture arose within
the past ≈65,000 years, which is a time frame that covers from the earliest of the 'Out of Africa' migrations
up to now.
Ringworm is a fungal disease that targets hairy skin.[60]
Premature greying of hair is another condition that results in greying before the age of 20 years in
Europeans, before 25 years in Asians, and before 30 years in Africans.[61]
Hair care involves the hygiene and cosmetology of hair including hair on the scalp, facial hair (beard and
moustache), pubic hair and other body hair. Hair care routines differ according to an individual's culture and
the physical characteristics of one's hair. Hair may be colored, trimmed, shaved, plucked, or otherwise
removed with treatments such as waxing, sugaring, and threading.

Removal practices
Many razors have multiple blades
purportedly to ensure a close shave.
While shaving initially will leave skin
feeling smooth and hair free, new
hair growth can appear a few hours
after hair removal.
Depilation is the removal of hair from the surface of the skin. This can be achieved through methods such
as shaving. Epilation is the removal of the entire hair strand, including the part of the hair that has not yet
left the follicle. A popular way to epilate hair is through waxing.
Shaving is accomplished with bladed instruments, such as razors.
The blade is brought close to the skin and stroked over the hair in
the desired area to cut the terminal hairs and leave the skin feeling
smooth. Depending upon the rate of growth, one can begin to feel
the hair growing back within hours of shaving. This is especially
evident in men who develop a five o'clock shadow after having
shaved their faces. This new growth is called stubble. Stubble
typically appears to grow back thicker because the shaved hairs are
blunted instead of tapered off at the end, although the hair never
actually grows back thicker.
Waxing involves using a sticky wax and strip of paper or cloth to
pull hair from the root. Waxing is the ideal hair removal technique
to keep an area hair-free for long periods of time. It can take three to
five weeks for waxed hair to begin to resurface again. Hair in areas that have been waxed consistently is
known to grow back finer and thinner, especially compared to hair that has been shaved with a razor.
Laser hair removal is a cosmetic method where a small laser beam pulses selective heat on dark target
matter in the area that causes hair growth without harming the skin tissue. This process is repeated several
times over the course of many months to a couple of years with hair regrowing less frequently until it finally
stops; this is used as a more permanent solution to waxing or shaving. Laser removal is practiced in many
clinics along with many at-home products.
Because the hair on one's head is normally longer than other types of body hair, it is cut with scissors or
clippers. People with longer hair will most often use scissors to cut their hair, whereas shorter hair is
maintained using a trimmer. Depending on the desired length and overall health of the hair, periods without
cutting or trimming the hair can vary.
Cut hair may be used in wigs. Global imports of hair in 2010 was worth $US 1.24 billion.[62]
Hair has great social significance for human beings.[63][64] It can grow on most external areas of the human
body, except on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet (among other areas). Hair is most noticeable
on most people in a small number of areas, which are also the ones that are most commonly trimmed,

plucked, or shaved. These include the face, ears, head, eyebrows, legs, and
armpits, as well as the pubic region. The highly visible differences between
male and female body and facial hair are a notable secondary sex
characteristic.
The world's longest documented hair belongs to Xie Qiuping (in China), at
5.627 m (18  ft 5.54 in) when measured on 8 May 2004. She has been
growing her hair since 1973, from the age of 13.[65]
Healthy hair indicates health and youth (important in evolutionary biology).
Hair color and texture can be a sign of ethnic ancestry. Facial hair is a sign
of puberty in men. White or gray hair is a sign of age or genetics, which
may be concealed with hair dye (not easily for some), although many prefer
to assume it (especially if it is a poliosis characteristic of the person since
childhood). Pattern baldness in men is usually seen as a sign of aging that
may be concealed with a toupee, hats, or religious and cultural adornments;
however, the condition can be triggered by various hormonal factors at any
age following puberty and is not uncommon in younger men. Although pattern baldness can be slowed
down by drugs such as Finasteride and Minoxidil or treated with hair transplants, many men see this as
unnecessary effort for the sake of vanity and instead shave their heads. In early modern China, the queue
was a male hairstyle in which the hair at the front and top was shaved every 10 days in a style mimicking
pattern baldness, while the remaining hair at the back was braided into a long pigtail.
A hairstyle may be an indicator of group membership. During the English Civil War, followers of Oliver
Cromwell cropped their hair close to their head in an act of defiance against the curls and ringlets of the
king's men, which led to them being nicknamed Roundheads.[66] Recent isotopic analysis of hair is helping
to shed further light on sociocultural interaction, giving information on food procurement and consumption
in the 19th century.[67] Having bobbed hair was popular among the flappers in the 1920s as a sign of
rebellion against traditional roles for women. Female art students known as the Cropheads also adopted the
style, notably at the Slade School in London. Regional variations in hirsutism has caused practices
regarding hair on the arms and legs to differ. Some religious groups may follow certain rules regarding hair
as part of religious observance. The rules often differ for men and women.
Many subcultures have hairstyles which may indicate an unofficial membership. Many hippies, metalheads,
and Indian sadhus have long hair, as well many older hipsters. Many punks wear a hairstyle known as a
mohawk or other spiked and dyed hairstyles, while skinheads have short-cropped or completely shaved
heads. Long stylized bangs were very common for emos, scene kids, and younger hipsters in the 2000s and
early 2010s.
Heads were shaved in concentration camps, and head-shaving has been used as punishment, especially for
women with long hair. The shaven head is common in military haircuts, while Western monks are known
for the tonsure. By contrast, among some Indian holy men, the hair is worn extremely long.[68][69][70][71]
In the time of Confucius (5th century BCE), the Chinese grew out their hair and often tied it, as a symbol of
filial piety. Regular hairdressing in some cultures is considered a sign of wealth or status. The dreadlocks of
the Rastafari movement were despised early in the movement's history. In some cultures, having one's hair
Indication of status
cut can symbolize a liberation from one's past, usually after a trying time in one's life. Cutting the hair also
may be a sign of mourning.
Tightly coiled hair in its natural state may be worn in an Afro. This hairstyle was once worn among African
Americans as a symbol of racial pride. Given that the coiled texture is the natural state of some African
Americans' hair, or perceived as being more "African", this simple style is now often seen as a sign of self-
acceptance and an affirmation that the beauty norms of the (eurocentric) dominant culture are not absolute.
African Americans as a whole have a variety of hair textures, as they are not an ethnically homogeneous
group, but an ad-hoc of different racial admixtures.
The film Easy Rider (1969) includes the assumption that the two main characters could have their long hairs
forcibly shaved with a rusty razor when jailed, symbolizing the intolerance of some conservative groups
toward members of the counterculture. At the conclusion of England's 1971 Oz trials, the defendants had
their heads shaved by the police, causing public outcry. During the appeal trial, they appeared in the dock
wearing wigs.[72] A case where a 14-year-old student was expelled from school in Brazil in the mid-2000s,
allegedly because of his fauxhawk haircut, sparked national debate and legal action resulting in
compensation.[73][74]
Women's hair may be hidden using headscarves, a common part of the hijab in Islam and a symbol of
modesty required for certain religious rituals in Eastern Orthodoxy. Russian Orthodox Church requires all
married women to wear headscarves inside the church; this tradition is often extended to all women,
regardless of marital status. Orthodox Judaism also commands the use of scarves and other head coverings
for married women for modesty reasons. Certain Hindu sects also wear head scarves for religious reasons.
Sikhs have an obligation not to cut hair (a Sikh cutting hair becomes 'apostate' which means fallen from
religion)[75] and men keep it tied in a bun on the head, which is then covered appropriately using a turban.
Multiple religions, both ancient and contemporary, require or advise one to allow their hair to become
dreadlocks, though people also wear them for fashion. For men, Islam, Orthodox Judaism, Orthodox
Christianity, Roman Catholicism, and other religious groups have at various times recommended or required
the covering of the head and sections of the hair of men, and some have dictates relating to the cutting of
men's facial and head hair. Some Christian sects throughout history and up to modern times have also
religiously proscribed the cutting of women's hair. For some Sunni madhabs, the donning of a kufi or topi is
a form of sunnah.[76] Brahmin males are prescribed to shave their heads, but leave a tuft of hair unshaved,
worn in the form of a topknot.[77]
Since ancient times, women's long, thick, wavy hair has featured prominently in Arabic poetry.[78] Pre-
Islamic poets used only limited imagery to describe women's hair.[78] For example, al-A'sha wrote a verse
comparing a lover's hair to "a garden whose grapes dangle down upon me", but Bashshar ibn Burd
considered this unusual.[78] One comparison used by early poets, such as Imru al-Qays, was to bunches of
dates.[78] In Abbasid times, however, the imagery for hair expanded significantly - particularly for the then-
fashionable "love-locks" (sudgh) framing the temples, which came into style at the court of the caliph al-
Religious practices
In Arabic poetry
Amin.[78] Hair curls were compared to hooks and chains, letters (such as fa, waw, lam, and nun),
scorpions, annelids, and polo sticks.[78] An example was the poet Ibn al-Mu'tazz, who compared a lock of
hair and a birthmark to a polo stick driving a ball.[78]
