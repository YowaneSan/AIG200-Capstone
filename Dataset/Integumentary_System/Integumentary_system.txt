Anatomical terminology
Integumentary system
The integumentary system is the set of organs forming the
outermost layer of an animal's body. It comprises the skin and
its appendages, which act as a physical barrier between the
external environment and the internal environment that it serves
to protect and maintain the body of the animal. Mainly it is the
body's outer skin.
The integumentary system includes skin, hair, scales, feathers,
hooves, and nails. It has a variety of additional functions: it may
serve to maintain water balance, protect the deeper tissues,
excrete wastes, and regulate body temperature, and is the
attachment site for sensory receptors which detect pain,
sensation, pressure, and temperature.
The skin is one of the largest organs of the body. In humans, it
accounts for about 12 to 15 percent of total body weight and
covers 1.5 to 2 m2 of surface area.[1]
The skin (integument) is a composite organ, made up of at least
two major layers of tissue: the epidermis and the dermis.[2] The
epidermis is the outermost layer, providing the initial barrier to
the external environment. It is separated from the dermis by the
basement membrane (basal lamina and reticular lamina). The
epidermis contains melanocytes and gives color to the skin. The
deepest layer of the epidermis also contains nerve endings.
Beneath this, the dermis comprises two sections, the papillary
and reticular layers, and contains connective tissues, vessels,
glands, follicles, hair roots, sensory nerve endings, and
muscular tissue.[3]
Between the integument and the deep body musculature there is a transitional subcutaneous zone made up
of very loose connective and adipose tissue, the hypodermis. Substantial collagen bundles anchor the
dermis to the hypodermis in a way that permits most areas of the skin to move freely over the deeper tissue
layers.[4]

Epidermis and dermis of human skin
The epidermis is the
strong, 
superficial
layer that serves as
the 
first 
line 
of
protection against the
outer 
environment.
The 
human
epidermis 
is
composed 
of
stratified 
squamous
epithelial 
cells,
which further break down into four to five layers: the stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum
spinosum and stratum basale. Where the skin is thicker, such as in the palms and soles, there is an extra
layer of skin between the stratum corneum and the stratum granulosum, called the stratum lucidum. The
epidermis is regenerated from the stem cells found in the basal layer that develop into the corneum. The
epidermis itself is devoid of blood supply and draws its nutrition from its underlying dermis.[5]
Its main functions are protection, absorption of nutrients, and homeostasis. In structure, it consists of a
keratinized stratified squamous epithelium; four types of cells: keratinocytes, melanocytes, Merkel cells, and
Langerhans cells.
The predominant cell keratinocyte, which produces keratin, a fibrous protein that aids in skin protection, is
responsible for the formation of the epidermal water barrier by making and secreting lipids.[6] The majority
of the skin on the human body is keratinized, with the exception of the lining of mucous membranes, such
as the inside of the mouth. Non-keratinized cells allow water to "stay" atop the structure.
The protein keratin stiffens epidermal tissue to form fingernails. Nails grow from a thin area called the nail
matrix at an average of 1 mm per week. The lunula is the crescent-shape area at the base of the nail, lighter
in color as it mixes with matrix cells. Only primates have nails. In other vertebrates, the keratinizing system
at the terminus of each digit produces claws or hooves.[2]
The epidermis of vertebrates is surrounded by two kinds of coverings, which are produced by the epidermis
itself. In fish and aquatic amphibians, it is a thin mucus layer that is constantly being replaced. In terrestrial
vertebrates, it is the stratum corneum (dead keratinized cells). The epidermis is, to some degree, glandular in
all vertebrates, but more so in fish and amphibians. Multicellular epidermal glands penetrate the dermis,
where they are surrounded by blood capillaries that provide nutrients and, in the case of endocrine glands,
transport their products.[7]
The dermis is the underlying connective tissue layer that supports the epidermis. It is composed of dense
irregular connective tissue and areolar connective tissue such as a collagen with elastin arranged in a
diffusely bundled and woven pattern.
The dermis has two layers: the papillary dermis and the reticular layer. The papillary layer is the superficial
layer that forms finger-like projections into the epidermis (dermal papillae),[5] and consists of highly
vascularized, loose connective tissue. The reticular layer is the deep layer of the dermis and consists of the
Dermis
dense irregular connective tissue. These layers serve to give elasticity to the integument, allowing stretching
and conferring flexibility, while also resisting distortions, wrinkling, and sagging.[3] The dermal layer
provides a site for the endings of blood vessels and nerves. Many chromatophores are also stored in this
layer, as are the bases of integumental structures such as hair, feathers, and glands.
The hypodermis, otherwise known as the subcutaneous layer, is a layer beneath the skin. It invaginates into
the dermis and is attached to the latter, immediately above it, by collagen and elastin fibers. It is essentially
composed of a type of cell known as adipocytes, which are specialized in accumulating and storing fats.
These cells are grouped together in lobules separated by connective tissue.
The hypodermis acts as an energy reserve. The fats contained in the adipocytes can be put back into
circulation, via the venous route, during intense effort or when there is a lack of energy-providing
substances, and are then transformed into energy. The hypodermis participates, passively at least, in
thermoregulation since fat is a heat insulator.
The integumentary system has multiple roles in maintaining the body's equilibrium. All body systems work
in an interconnected manner to maintain the internal conditions essential to the function of the body. The
skin has an important job of protecting the body and acts as the body's first line of defense against infection,
temperature change, and other challenges to homeostasis.[8][9]
Its main functions include:
Protect the body's internal living tissues and organs
Protect against invasion by infectious organisms
Protect the body from dehydration
Protect the body against abrupt changes in temperature, maintain homeostasis
Help excrete waste materials through perspiration
Act as a receptor for touch, pressure, pain, heat, and cold (see Somatosensory system)
Protect the body against sunburns by secreting melanin
Generate vitamin D through exposure to ultraviolet light
Store water, fat, glucose, vitamin D
Maintenance of the body form
Formation of new cells from stratum germinativum to repair minor injuries
Protect from UV rays.
Regulates body temperature
It distinguishes, separates, and protects the organism from its surroundings.
Small-bodied invertebrates of aquatic or continually moist habitats respire using the outer layer
(integument). This gas exchange system, where gases simply diffuse into and out of the interstitial fluid, is
called integumentary exchange.
