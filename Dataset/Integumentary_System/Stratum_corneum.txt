Stratum corneum
The stratum corneum (Latin for 'horny layer') is the outermost
layer of the epidermis. Consisting of dead tissue, it protects
underlying tissue from infection, dehydration, chemicals and
mechanical stress. It is composed of 15–20 layers of flattened
cells with no nuclei and cell organelles.
Among its properties are mechanical shear, impact resistance,
water flux and hydration regulation, microbial proliferation and
invasion regulation, initiation of inflammation through cytokine
activation and dendritic cell activity, and selective permeability
to exclude toxins, irritants, and allergens.[2] The cytoplasm of
its cells shows filamentous keratin. These corneocytes are
embedded in a lipid matrix composed of ceramides, cholesterol,
and fatty acids.[3]
Desquamation is the process of cell shedding from the surface
of the stratum corneum, balancing proliferating keratinocytes
that form in the stratum basale. These cells migrate through the
epidermis towards the surface in a journey that takes
approximately fourteen days.[4]
The human stratum corneum comprises several levels of
flattened corneocytes that are divided into two layers: the
stratum disjunctum and stratum compactum. The skin's
protective acid mantle and lipid barrier sit on top of the stratum
disjunctum.[5] The stratum disjunctum is the uppermost and loosest
layer of skin. The stratum compactum is the comparatively deeper,
more compacted and more cohesive part of the stratum corneum.[6]
The corneocytes of the stratum disjunctum are larger, more rigid
and more hydrophobic than those of the stratum compactum.[7]
Research on osmotic permeability suggests the stratum compactum
consists of two layers. The stratum disjunctum above these layers
can swell, as can the lowest layer of the stratum disjunctum (two-
fold). However, the first layer in the stratum compactum between
them has limited swelling capacity and provides the stratum
corneum's barrier.[8]
Structure
Function
During cornification, the process whereby living keratinocytes are transformed into non-living corneocytes,
the cell membrane is replaced by a layer of ceramides which become covalently linked to an envelope of
structural proteins (the cornified envelope).[4]permeabilitys complex surrounds cells in the stratum corneum
and contributes to the skin's barrier function. Corneodesmosomes (modified desmosomes) facilitate cellular
adhesion by linking adjacent cells within this epidermal layer. These complexes are degraded by proteases,
eventually permitting cells to be shed at the surface. Desquamation and formation of the cornified envelope
are both required for the maintenance of skin homeostasis. A failure to correctly regulate these processes
leads to skin disorders developing.[4]
Cells of the stratum corneum contain a dense network of keratin, a protein that helps keep the skin hydrated
by preventing water evaporation. These cells can also absorb water, further aiding in hydration. In addition,
this layer is responsible for the "spring back" or stretchy properties of skin. A weak glutenous protein bond
pulls the skin back to its natural shape.
The thickness of the stratum corneum varies throughout the body. In the palms of the hands and the soles of
the feet (sometimes knees, elbows,[9] knuckles,) this layer is stabilized and built by the stratum lucidum
(clear phase) which allows the cells to concentrate keratin and toughen them before they rise into a typically
thicker, more cohesive SC. The mechanical stress of heavy structural strain causes this SL phase in these
regions which require additional protection in order to grasp objects, resist abrasion or impact, and avoid
injury. In general, the stratum corneum contains 15 to 20 layers of corneocytes. The stratum corneum has a
thickness between 10 and 40 μm.
In reptiles, the stratum corneum is permanent, and is replaced only during times of rapid growth, in a
process called ecdysis or moulting. This is conferred by the presence of beta-keratin, which provides a
much more rigid skin layer.
In the human forearm, about 1300 cells per cm2 per hour are shed.[10] Stratum corneum protects the internal
structures of the body from external injury and bacterial invasion.
An inability to correctly maintain the skin barrier function due to the dysregulation of epidermal
components can lead to skin disorders. For example, a failure to modulate the activity of kallikreins via the
disruption of the protease inhibitor LEKTI causes the debilitating disorder Netherton syndrome.[11]
Hyperkeratosis is an increased thickness of the stratum corneum, and is an unspecific finding, seen in many
skin conditions.
