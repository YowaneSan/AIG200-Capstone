Stratified squamous epithelium
A stratified squamous epithelium consists of squamous
(flattened) epithelial cells arranged in layers upon a basal
membrane. Only one layer is in contact with the basement
membrane; the other layers adhere to one another to maintain
structural integrity. Although this epithelium is referred to as
squamous, many cells within the layers may not be flattened;
this is due to the convention of naming epithelia according to
the cell type at the surface. In the deeper layers, the cells may
be columnar or cuboidal.[1] There are no intercellular spaces.
This type of epithelium is well suited to areas in the body
subject to constant abrasion, as the thickest layers can be
sequentially sloughed off and replaced before the basement
membrane is exposed. It forms the outermost layer of the skin
and the inner lining of the mouth, esophagus and vagina.[2]
In the epidermis of skin in mammals, reptiles, and birds, the
layer of keratin in the outer layer of the stratified squamous
epithelial surface is named the stratum corneum. Stratum
corneum is made up of squamous cells which are keratinized
and dead. These are shed periodically.
Non-keratinized surfaces must be kept moist by bodily
secretions to prevent them from drying out. Cells of stratum
corneum are sometimes without keratin and living.
Examples of non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium
include some parts of the lining of oral cavity, pharynx,
conjunctiva of eye, upper one-third esophagus, rectum, vulva,
and vagina.
Even non-keratinized surfaces, consisting as they do of
keratinocytes, have a minor superficial keratinized layer of
varying thickness, depending on the age of the epithelium and
the damage it has experienced.

Anatomical terms of microanatomy
Keratinized surfaces are protected from absorption by keratin
protein. Keratinized epithelium has keratin deposited on the
surface which makes it impermeable and dry. Examples of
keratinized stratified squamous epithelium include skin, the
epidermis of the palm of the hand, and the sole of the foot,[3]
and the masticatory mucosa.
