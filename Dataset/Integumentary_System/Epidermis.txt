Epidermis
The epidermis is the outermost of the three layers that comprise
the skin, the inner layers being the dermis and hypodermis.[1]
The epidermis layer provides a barrier to infection from
environmental pathogens[2] and regulates the amount of water
released from the body into the atmosphere through
transepidermal water loss.[3]
The epidermis is composed of multiple layers of flattened
cells[4] that overlie a base layer (stratum basale) composed of
columnar cells arranged perpendicularly. The layers of cells
develop from stem cells in the basal layer. The thickness of the
epidermis varies from 31.2μm for the penis to 596.6μm for the
sole of the foot with most being roughly 90μm. Thickness does
not vary between the sexes but becomes thinner with age.[5]
The human epidermis is an example of epithelium, particularly
a stratified squamous epithelium.
The word epidermis is derived through Latin from Ancient
Greek epidermis, itself from Ancient Greek epi 'over, upon' and
from Ancient Greek derma 'skin'. Something related to or part
of the epidermis is termed epidermal.
The 
epidermis 
primarily 
consists 
of 
keratinocytes[4]
(proliferating basal and differentiated suprabasal), which
comprise 90% of its cells, but also contains melanocytes,
Langerhans cells, Merkel cells,[6]: 
2–3  and inflammatory cells.
Epidermal thickenings called Rete ridges (or rete pegs) extend
downward between dermal papillae.[7] Blood capillaries are
found beneath the epidermis, and are linked to an arteriole and
a venule. The epidermis itself has no blood supply and is
nourished almost exclusively by diffused oxygen from the
surrounding air.[8] Cellular mechanisms for regulating water
and sodium levels (ENaCs) are found in all layers of the
epidermis.[9]

Epidermal cells are tightly interconnected to serve as a tight
barrier against the exterior environment. The junctions between
the epidermal cells are of the adherens junction type, formed by
transmembrane proteins called cadherins. Inside the cell, the
cadherins are linked to actin filaments. In immunofluorescence
microscopy, the actin filament network appears as a thick
border surrounding the cells,[9] although the actin filaments are
actually located inside the cell and run parallel to the cell
membrane. Because of the proximity of the neighboring cells
and tightness of the junctions, the actin immunofluorescence
appears as a border between cells.[9]
The epidermis is composed of 4 or 5 layers, depending on the
region of skin being considered.[10] Those layers from
outermost to innermost are:[2]
cornified layer (stratum corneum)
Composed of 10 to 30 layers of polyhedral,
anucleated corneocytes (final step of keratinocyte
differentiation), with the palms and soles having the
most layers. Corneocytes contain a protein
envelope (cornified envelope proteins) underneath the
plasma membrane, are filled with water-retaining
keratin proteins, attached together through
corneodesmosomes and surrounded in the
extracellular space by stacked layers of lipids.[11] Most
of the barrier functions of the epidermis localize to this
layer.[12]
clear/translucent layer (stratum lucidum, only in palms
and soles)
This narrow layer is found only on the palms and
soles. The epidermis of these two areas is known as
"thick skin" because with this extra layer, the skin has 5
epidermal layers instead of 4.
granular layer (stratum granulosum)
Keratinocytes lose their nuclei and their cytoplasm
appears granular. Lipids, contained into those
keratinocytes within lamellar bodies, are released into
the extracellular space through exocytosis to form a lipid barrier that prevents water loss
from the body as well as entry of foreign substances. Those polar lipids are then converted
into non-polar lipids and arranged parallel to the cell surface. For example
glycosphingolipids become ceramides and phospholipids become free fatty acids.[11]
spinous layer (stratum spinosum)
Keratinocytes become connected through desmosomes and produce lamellar bodies, from
within the Golgi, enriched in polar lipids, glycosphingolipids, free sterols, phospholipids
and catabolic enzymes.[3] Langerhans cells, immunologically active cells, are located in
the middle of this layer.[11]
basal/germinal layer (stratum basale/germinativum)
Composed mainly of proliferating and non-proliferating keratinocytes, attached to the
basement membrane by hemidesmosomes. Melanocytes are present, connected to

numerous keratinocytes in this and other strata through

basale with large numbers in touch-sensitive sites
such as the fingertips and lips. They are closely
associated with cutaneous nerves and seem to be
involved in light touch sensation.[11]
Malpighian layer (stratum malpighii)
This is usually defined as both the stratum basale and
stratum spinosum.[4]
The epidermis is separated from the dermis, its underlying tissue, by
a basement membrane.
As a stratified squamous epithelium, the epidermis is maintained by
cell division within the stratum basale. Differentiating cells
delaminate from the basement membrane and are displaced outward
through the epidermal layers, undergoing multiple stages of
differentiation until, in the stratum corneum, losing their nucleus
and fusing to squamous sheets, which are eventually shed from the
surface (desquamation). Differentiated keratinocytes secrete keratin
proteins, which contribute to the formation of an extracellular
matrix that is an integral part of the skin barrier function. In normal
skin, the rate of keratinocyte production equals the rate of loss,[4]
taking about two weeks for a cell to journey from the stratum basale
to the top of the stratum granulosum, and an additional four weeks
to cross the stratum corneum.[2] The entire epidermis is replaced by
new cell growth over a period of about 48 days.[13]
Keratinocyte differentiation throughout the epidermis is in part
mediated by a calcium gradient, increasing from the stratum basale
until the outer stratum granulosum, where it reaches its maximum,
and decreasing in the stratum corneum. Calcium concentration in
the stratum corneum is very low in part because those relatively dry
cells are not able to dissolve the ions. This calcium gradient
parallels keratinocyte differentiation and as such is considered a key
regulator in the formation of the epidermal layers.[3]
Elevation of extracellular calcium concentrations induces an
increase in intracellular free calcium concentrations.[14] Part of that
intracellular increase comes from calcium released from intracellular
stores[15] and another part comes from transmembrane calcium influx,[16] through both calcium-sensitive

chloride channels[17] and voltage-independent cation channels
permeable to calcium.[18] Moreover, it has been suggested that an
extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) also contributes to
the rise in intracellular calcium concentration.[19]
Epidermal organogenesis, the formation of the epidermis, begins in
the cells covering the embryo after neurulation, the formation of the
central nervous system. In most vertebrates, this original one-
layered structure quickly transforms into a two-layered tissue; a
temporary outer layer, the periderm, which is disposed once the
inner basal layer or stratum germinativum has formed.[20]
This inner layer is a germinal epithelium that gives rise to all
epidermal cells. It divides to form the outer spinous layer (stratum
spinosum). The cells of these two layers, together called the Malpighian layer(s) after Marcello Malpighi,
divide to form the superficial granular layer (Stratum granulosum) of the epidermis.[20]
The cells in the stratum granulosum do not divide, but instead form skin cells called keratinocytes from the
granules of keratin. These skin cells finally become the cornified layer (stratum corneum), the outermost
epidermal layer, where the cells become flattened sacks with their nuclei located at one end of the cell. After
birth these outermost cells are replaced by new cells from the stratum granulosum and throughout life they
are shed at a rate of 30 - 90 milligrams of skin flakes every hour, or 0.720 - 2.16 grams per day.[21]
Epidermal development is a product of several growth factors, two of which are:[20]
Transforming growth factor Alpha (TGFα) is an autocrine growth factor by which basal cells
stimulate their own division.
Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF or FGF7) is a paracrine growth factor produced by the
underlying dermal fibroblasts in which the proliferation of basal cells is regulated.
The epidermis serves as a barrier to protect the body against microbial pathogens, oxidant stress (UV light),
and chemical compounds, and provides mechanical resistance to minor injury. Most of this barrier role is
played by the stratum corneum.[12]
Characteristics
Physical barrier: Epidermal keratinocytes are tightly linked by cell–cell junctions associated
to cytoskeletal proteins, giving the epidermis its mechanical strength.[3]
Chemical barrier: Highly organized lipids, acids, hydrolytic enzymes, and antimicrobial
peptides[3] inhibit passage of external chemicals and pathogens into the body.
Immunologically active barrier: The humoral and cellular constituents of the immune
system[3] found in the epidermis actively combat infection.
Development
Function
Barrier
Water content of the stratum corneum drops towards the surface, creating hostile conditions
for pathogenic microorganism growth.[12]
An acidic pH (around 5.0) and low amounts of water make the epidermis hostile to many
microorganic pathogens.[12]
Non-pathogenic microorganisms on the surface of the epidermis help defend against
pathogens by competing for food, limiting its availability, and producing chemical secretions
that inhibit the growth of pathogenic microbiota.[12]
Permeability
Psychological stress, through an increase in glucocorticoids, compromises the stratum
corneum and thus the barrier function.[22]
Sudden and large shifts in humidity alter stratum corneum hydration in a way that could
allow entry of pathogenic microorganisms.[23]
The ability of the skin to hold water is primarily due to the stratum corneum and is critical for maintaining
healthy skin.[24] Skin hydration is quantified using corneometry.[25] Lipids arranged through a gradient and
in an organized manner between the cells of the stratum corneum form a barrier to transepidermal water
loss.[26][27]
The amount and distribution of melanin pigment in the epidermis is the main reason for variation in skin
color in Homo sapiens. Melanin is found in the small melanosomes, particles formed in melanocytes from
where they are transferred to the surrounding keratinocytes. The size, number, and arrangement of the
melanosomes vary between racial groups, but while the number of melanocytes can vary between different
body regions, their numbers remain the same in individual body regions in all human beings. In white and
Asian skin the melanosomes are packed in "aggregates", but in black skin they are larger and distributed
more evenly. The number of melanosomes in the keratinocytes increases with UV radiation exposure, while
their distribution remain largely unaffected.[28]
The skin contains specialized epidermal touch receptor cells called Merkel cells. Historically, the role of
Merkel cells in sensing touch has been thought to be indirect, due their close association with nerve
endings. However, recent work in mice and other model organisms demonstrates that Merkel cells
intrinsically transform touch into electrical signals that are transmitted to the nervous system.[29]
Laboratory culture of keratinocytes to form a 3D structure (artificial skin) recapitulating most of the
properties of the epidermis is routinely used as a tool for drug development and testing.
Epidermal hyperplasia (thickening resulting from cell proliferation) has various forms:
Skin hydration
Skin color
Touch
Clinical significance
Hyperplasia
Acanthosis is diffuse epidermal hyperplasia (thickening of the skin, and not to be confused
with acanthocytes).[30] It implies increased thickness of the Malpighian layer (stratum basale
and stratum spinosum).[31] Acanthosis nigricans is a black, poorly defined, velvety
hyperpigmented acanthosis, usually observed in the back of neck, axilla, and other folded
regions of the skin.
Focal epithelial hyperplasia (Heck's disease) is an asymptomatic, benign neoplastic
condition characterized by multiple white to pinkish papules that occur diffusely in the oral
cavity.[32][6]: 
411 
Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia (PEH) is a benign condition characterized by
hyperplasia of the epidermis and epithelium of skin appendages,[33] with irregular squamous
strands extending down into the dermis,[34] and closely simulating squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC).[33]
