Female reproductive system
The female reproductive system is made up of the internal
and external sex organs that function in the reproduction of new
offspring. The human female reproductive system is immature
at birth and develops to maturity at puberty to be able to
produce gametes, and to carry a fetus to full term. The internal
sex organs are the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.
The female reproductive tract includes the vagina, uterus, and
fallopian tubes and is prone to infections.[1] The vagina allows
for sexual intercourse and childbirth, and is connected to the
uterus at the cervix. The uterus or womb accommodates the
embryo, which develops into the fetus. The uterus also
produces secretions, which help the transit of sperm to the
fallopian tubes, where sperm fertilize ova (egg cells) produced
by the ovaries. The external sex organs are also known as the
genitals and these are the organs of the vulva including the
labia, clitoris, and vaginal opening.[2]
During the menstrual cycle, the ovaries release an ovum, which
transits through the fallopian tube into the uterus. If an egg cell
meets with sperm on its way to the uterus, a single sperm cell
can enter and merge with it, fertilizing it into a zygote.
Fertilization usually occurs in the fallopian tubes and marks the
beginning of embryogenesis. The zygote will then divide over
enough generations of cells to form a blastocyst, which
implants itself in the wall of the uterus. This begins the period
of gestation and the embryo will continue to develop until full-
term. When the fetus has developed enough to survive outside
the uterus, the cervix dilates and contractions of the uterus
propel the newborn through the birth canal (the vagina).
The corresponding equivalent among males is the male
reproductive system.
The vulva is of all of the external parts and tissues and includes the following:[3]
Clitoris: an organ located at the top of the vulva. It consists of the body and its pea-shaped
glans that is protected by the clitoral hood. The corpora cavernosa are tissues of the clitoris

Vestibular glands/female accessory glands:
two pairs of glands in the vulval vestibule
known as the Bartholin's glands, which
produce a mucous fluid for vaginal

ejaculation of fluid as well as for lubricating
the meatus.
The vagina is a fibromuscular (made up of fibrous and
muscular tissue) canal leading from the outside of the
body to the cervix of the uterus. It is also referred to as
the birth canal in the context of pregnancy. The vagina
accommodates a penis during sexual intercourse.
Semen containing spermatozoa is ejaculated from the
penis at orgasm, into the vagina potentially enabling
fertilization of the egg cell (ovum) to take place.
The cervix is the neck of the uterus, the lower, narrow portion where it joins with the upper part of the
vagina. It is cylindrical or conical in shape and protrudes through the upper anterior vaginal wall.
Approximately half its length is visible, the remainder lies above the vagina beyond view. The vagina has a
thick layer outside and it is the opening where the fetus emerges during delivery.

reproductive system (sagittal view)
The uterus or womb is the major female reproductive organ. The
uterus provides mechanical protection, nutritional support, and
waste removal for the developing embryo (weeks 1 to 8) and fetus
(from week 9 until the delivery). In addition, contractions in the
muscular wall of the uterus are important in pushing out the fetus at
the time of birth.
The uterus contains three suspensory ligaments that help stabilize
the position of the uterus and limits its range of movement. The
uterosacral ligaments keep the body from moving inferiorly and
anteriorly. The round ligaments restrict posterior movement of the
uterus. The cardinal ligaments also prevent the inferior movement
of the uterus.
The uterus is a pear-shaped muscular organ. Its major function is to
accept a fertilized ovum, which becomes implanted into the
endometrium, and derives nourishment from blood vessels, which
develop exclusively for this purpose. The fertilized ovum becomes
an embryo, develops into a fetus and gestates until childbirth. If the
egg does not embed in the wall of the uterus, the female begins
menstruation.[4]
The fallopian tubes are two tubes leading from the ovaries into the
uterus. On maturity of an ovum, the follicle and the ovary's wall
rupture, allowing the ovum to escape and enter the fallopian tube.
There it travels toward the uterus, pushed along by movements of
cilia on the inner lining of the tubes. This trip takes hours or days. If
the ovum is fertilized while in the fallopian tube, then it normally
implants in the endometrium when it reaches the uterus, which
signals the beginning of pregnancy.[5]
The ovaries are small, paired gonads located near the lateral walls
of the pelvic cavity. These organs are responsible for the production
of the egg cells (ova) and the secretion of hormones. The process
by which the egg cell (ovum) is released is called ovulation. The
speed of ovulation is periodic and impacts directly to the length of a
menstrual cycle.

After ovulation, the egg cell is travels through the fallopian tube
toward the uterus. If fertilization is going to occur, it often happens
in the fallopian tube; the fertilized egg can then proceed to try and
implant on the uterus's lining.[6][7] During fertilization the egg cell
plays a role; it releases certain molecules that are essential to
guiding the sperm and allows the surface of the egg to attach to the
sperm's surface. The egg can then absorb the sperm and fertilization
can then begin.[8]
The female reproductive system functions to produce offspring.
In the absence of fertilization, the ovum will eventually traverse the entire reproductive tract from the
fallopian tube until exiting the vagina through menstruation.
The reproductive tract can be used for various transluminal procedures such as fertiloscopy, intrauterine
insemination, and transluminal sterilization.
Chromosome characteristics determine the genetic sex of a fetus at conception. This is specifically based on
the 23rd pair of chromosomes that is inherited. Since the mother's egg contains an X chromosome and the
father's sperm contains either an X or Y chromosome, it is the male who determines the fetus' sex. If the
fetus inherits the X chromosome from the father, the fetus will be a female. In this case, testosterone is not
made and the Wolffian duct will degrade thus, the Müllerian duct will develop into female sex organs. The
clitoris is the remnants of the Wolffian duct. On the other hand, if the fetus inherits the Y chromosome from
the father, the fetus will be a male. The presence of testosterone will stimulate the Wolffian duct, which will
bring about the development of the male sex organs and the Müllerian duct will degrade.[9]
Vaginitis is inflammation of the vagina and largely caused by an infection. It is the most common
gynaecological condition presented.[10] It is difficult to determine any one organism most responsible for
vaginitis because it varies from range of age, sexual activity, and method of microbial identification.
Vaginitis is not necessarily caused by a sexually transmitted infection as there are many infectious agents
that make use of the close proximity to mucous membranes and secretions. Vaginitis is usually diagnosed
based on the presence of vaginal discharge, which can have a certain color, odor, or quality.[11]
This is a vaginal infection in women. It differs from vaginitis in that there is no inflammation. Bacterial
vaginosis is polymicrobial, consisting of many bacteria species. The diagnosis for bacterial vaginosis is
made if three of the following four criteria are present: (1) Homogenous, thin discharge, (2) a pH of 4.5 in

the vagina, (3) epithelial cells in the vagina with bacteria attached to them, or (4) a fishy odor. It has been
associated with an increased risk of other genital tract infections such as endometritis.[11]
This is a common cause of vaginal irritation and according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention at least 75% of adult women have experienced one at least once in their lifetime. Yeast infections
are caused by an overgrowth of fungus in the vagina known as Candida. Yeast infections are usually caused
by an imbalance of the pH in the vagina, which is usually acidic. Other factors such as pregnancy, diabetes,
weakened immune systems, tight fitting clothing, or douching can also be a cause. Symptoms of yeast
infections include itching, burning, irritation, and a white cottage-cheese-like discharge from the vagina.
Women have also reported that they experience painful intercourse and urination as well. Taking a sample
of the vaginal secretions and placing them under a microscope for evidence of yeast can diagnose a yeast
infection. Treatment varies from creams that can be applied in or around the vaginal area to oral tablets that
stop the growth of fungus.[11]
There are many practices of mutilating female genitalia in different cultures. The most common two types of
genital mutilation practiced are clitoridectomy, the circumcision of the clitoris and the excision of the clitoral
prepuce. They can all involve a range of adverse health consequences such as bleeding, irreparable tissue
damage, and sepsis, which can sometimes prove fatal.
Genitoplasty refers to surgery that is carried out to repair damaged sex organs particularly following cancer
and its treatment. There are also elective surgical procedures, which change the appearance of the external
genitals.
There are many types of birth control available to females. Birth control can be hormonal or physical in
nature. Oral contraception can assist with management of various medical conditions, such as
menorrhagia.[12] However, oral contraceptives can have a variety of side effects, including depression.[13]
The International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics was founded in 1954 to promote the well-
being of women particularly in raising the standards of gynaecological practice and care. As of 2010, there
were 124 countries involved.
Reproductive rights are legal rights related to reproduction and reproductive health. Women have the right
to control matters involving their sexuality including their sexual and reproductive health. Violation of these
rights include forced pregnancy, forced sterilization, forced abortion and genital mutilation. Female genital
mutilation is the complete or partial removal of a female's external genitals.

History
It is claimed in the Hippocratic writings that both males and females contribute their seed to conception;
otherwise, children would not resemble either or both of their parents. Four-hundred years later, Galen
"identified" the source of 'female semen' as the ovaries in female reproductive organs.[14]
