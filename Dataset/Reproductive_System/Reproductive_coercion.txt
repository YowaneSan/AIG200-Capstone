Reproductive coercion
Reproductive coercion (also called coerced reproduction, reproductive control or reproductive
abuse) is a collection of behaviors that interfere with decision-making related to reproductive health.[1]
These behaviors are meant to maintain power and control related to reproductive health by a current,
former, or hopeful intimate or romantic partner,[2][3] but they can also be perpetrated by parents or in-
laws.[4] Coercive behaviors infringe on individuals' reproductive rights and reduce their reproductive
autonomy.[5]
There are three forms of reproductive coercion, including pregnancy coercion, birth control sabotage, and
controlling the outcome of a pregnancy.[1][6]
Reproductive coercion and intimate partner violence are strongly correlated; however, reproductive
coercion can occur in relationships in which physical and sexual violence are not reported.[1] Reproductive
coercion and unintended pregnancy are strongly associated, and this association is stronger in individuals
who have experienced intimate partner violence.[1] While research remains fragmentary, women in abusive
relationships are at higher risk of reproductive coercion and unintended pregnancies.[7] Reproductive
coercion is considered a serious public health issue.[2][3]
Pregnancy coercion includes any behaviors intended to coerce or pressure a partner to become or not
become pregnant, or to coerce or pressure a partner to impregnate them.[1][6][8] Pregnancy coercion
involves various tactics, including verbal threats related to impregnation, coerced sex, refusal to use or
interference with male-controlled contraception (i.e., condoms, withdrawal), interference with or pressure
not to use or to use female controlled contraception (i.e., hormonal methods), monitoring menstrual cycles
or gynecological visits, pressure for or against sterilization or other medical related methods, and monitoring
of ovulation.[1] Threatened or completed physical violence may also be perpetrated against a partner to
coerce them to become pregnant or coerce a partner to impregnate them.[3][8]
Birth control sabotage involves tampering with contraception or interfering with the use of
contraception.[1][6] Birth control sabotage includes removing a condom after agreeing to wear one (also
called stealthing), damaging a condom, removing or lying about the use of contraception (including vaginal
rings, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and contraceptive patches), or throwing away or lying about the
consumption of oral contraceptive pills.[1][2][3][8] Other methods of birth control sabotage include
preventing a partner from obtaining or refilling contraceptive prescriptions, refusing to wear a condom,
stating that a condom is being worn when one is not, not withdrawing after agreeing to do so, not informing
a partner after ceasing the use of female-controlled contraception or removing contraceptive devices,[8] and
not telling a partner if a condom broke or fell off.[1][3]
Forms
Pregnancy coercion
Birth control sabotage
Gender and sexual power dynamics and coercion associated with sexual power dynamics are both linked to
condom nonuse.[9] Even women with high sexually transmitted infection knowledge are more likely to use
condoms inconsistently than women with low STI knowledge when there is a high level of fear for
abuse.[2]
Controlling the outcome of a pregnancy is an attempt to influence a partner to continue or terminate a
pregnancy.[1][6] This can include abortion coercion, or pressuring, threatening, or forcing a partner to have
an abortion or not.[1] A Guttmacher Institute policy analysis states that forcing a woman to terminate a
pregnancy she wants or to continue a pregnancy she does not want violates the basic human right of
reproductive health.[10]
Reproductive coercion in October 2018 was reported by 5-14% of women in family planning clinic
settings[1][5] and lifetime experience has been reported by 8-30% of women in a range of settings in the
US.[1][5]
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's survey on domestic violence includes questions
regarding control of reproductive health, specifically pregnancy pressure and birth control sabotage.[11] The
2011 study found that:
approximately 8.6% (or an estimated 10.3 million) of women in the United States reported
ever having an intimate partner who tried to get them pregnant when they did not want to, or
refused to use a condom, with 4.8% having had an intimate partner who tried to get them
pregnant when they did not want to, and 6.7% having had an intimate partner who refused to
wear a condom;
approximately 10.4% (or an estimated 11.7 million) of men in the United States reported ever
having an intimate partner who tried to get pregnant when they did not want to or tried to stop
them from using birth control, with 8.7% having had an intimate partner who tried to get
pregnant when they did not want to or tried to stop them from using birth control and 3.8%
having had an intimate partner who refused to wear a condom.
In a sample of urban women aged 18–44, 16% reported experiencing reproductive coercion.[1] In a family
planning clinic setting in California, 13% of patients reported experiencing reproductive coercion in
October 2018.[1] Among California girls aged 14–19 seeking school-based health services, 12.4% reported
experiencing reproductive coercion.[1] Among women aged 16–29 seeking family planning in California,
19.1% reported experiencing pregnancy coercion in their lifetime.[1] 15.0% of women in California, aged
16–29, seeking family planning reported experiencing birth control sabotage.[1] In a sample of college-aged
women in the northeastern United States, 8% reported experiencing reproductive coercion in their lifetime;
3.9% reported experiencing birth control sabotage in their lifetime, and 6.8% reported experiencing
pregnancy coercion in their lifetime.[1] In a Texas sample, 1% of non-pregnant women aged 16–40 reported
experiencing pregnancy coercion in their lifetime.[1] Among Pennsylvania family planning clinic patients,
reproductive coercion was reported at 5% in October 2018.[1] In a sample of adolescents aged 14–20 in
Boston, 20% had been coerced into having sex without a condom.[1]
Controlling the outcome of a pregnancy
Prevalence
United States
Among women seeking an abortion in the United States, between 0.1% and 2.0% are coerced to have an
abortion by an intimate partner.[1] Furthermore, one study of males between the age of 18-35 who had ever
had sex found that 4.1% had attempted to compel a partner to have an abortion and 8.0% attempted to
prevent a partner from having an abortion.[1]
Teenage girls in physically violent relationships are 3.5 times more likely to become pregnant and are 2.8
times more likely to fear the possible consequences of negotiating condom use than non-abused girls. They
are also half as likely to use condoms consistently compared to non-abused girls, and teenage boys
perpetrating dating violence are also less likely to use condoms.[2] Teenage mothers are nearly twice as
likely to have a repeat pregnancy within 2 years if they experienced abuse within three months after
delivery.[2] 26% of abused teenage girls reported that their boyfriends were trying to get them pregnant.[2]
In Bangladesh, 10% of married women experiencing intimate partner violence reported that their male
partner disagreed with them about using contraception.[4] Additionally, 10.4% of women who did not report
intimate partner violence reported that their male partner disagreed with them about using contraception.[4]
Among women seeking abortions in Northern China, 2.1% reported that they were being forced to have an
abortion by their partner.[4]
Among women in Côte d'Ivoire over the age of 18 with a male partner, lifetime prevalence rates of
reproductive coercion perpetrated by an in-law of 5.5% and 6.0% have been reported.[4] Lifetime
prevalence of reproductive coercion among women in Côte d'Ivoire over the age of 18 perpetrated by a
male partner is 18.5%.[4] Reproductive coercion by in-laws was reported by 15.9% of women who were
maltreated by their in-laws, versus 2.8% who were not maltreated.[4] Additionally, reproductive coercion by
in-laws was reported by 16.3% of women who experienced physical violence by their in-laws, versus 5.9%
who did not report violence.[4]
Among women who had abortions in Italy, 2% of those who did not experience intimate partner violence,
7% who experienced psychological violence, and 13% who experienced physical or sexual violence stated
that they become pregnant because their partner wanted them to be pregnant.[4] Furthermore, 4.5% of those
who did not experience intimate partner violence, 3.6% who experienced psychological violence, and
21.7% who experienced physical or sexual violence stated they had an abortion because their partner
wanted a child but they did not.[4]
Among married women aged 15–49 in Jordan, 13% reported that a parent or in-law tried to stop them from
using contraception, including their mother-in-law (36%), mother (27%), or sister-in-law (11%).[4]
Furthermore, 11% reported that their husband refused to use contraception or tried to stop them from using
contraception, and 89% reported their husband had expressed disapproval of contraception.[4] In total, 20%
of ever-married Jordanian women report that their husband or someone else has interfered with their
attempts to prevent pregnancy.[4]
In Nigeria, coercion by husband was more commonly a reason for IUD removal in younger women
(74.2%) than older women (25.8%), and in less educated women (46.7%) than more educated women
(33.3%).[4]
Other countries
In India, a study conducted in the state of Uttar Pradesh reported that about 1 out of 8 women (12%) were
subjected to Reproductive Coercion by their current husbands or in-laws. Additionally, 36% of the women
facing Reproductive Coercion reported that their current pregnancy was unintended.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that physicians should screen
patients for reproductive coercion periodically, including at annual examinations, during prenatal and
postpartum care, and at new patient visits.[3] According to the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists and Futures Without Violence recommendations, providers should assess for reproductive
coercion as part of routine family planning care and before discussing contraceptive options.[2][3]
Suggested screening questions in health settings for assessing potential reproductive coercion include:[2][3]
Has a current or former partner not let you use birth control, destroyed your birth control, or
refused to wear a condom?
Has your partner ever tried to get you pregnant when you didn't want to be?
Has your partner ever forced you to have an abortion or caused you to have a miscarriage?
Does your partner support your decision about when or if you want to become pregnant?
Do you and your partner agree on what you should do about your pregnancy?
Family planning clinicians can use strategies to help prevent adverse reproductive health outcomes among
women who experience reproductive coercion.[2] Strategies include educating patients on the reproductive
health impacts of reproductive coercion, counseling on harm reduction strategies, preventing unintended
pregnancies by offering discrete, effective birth control methods that may not be detectable by a partner
(such as IUDs, emergency contraception, contraceptive implants, or contraceptive injections), and assessing
their patient's safety prior to notifying partners about sexually transmitted infections.[2][3] Interventions that
provide awareness of reproductive coercion and provide harm reduction strategies to address reproductive
coercion have been found to reduce pregnancy coercion by 71% among women experiencing intimate
partner violence.[2]
Emergency contraception can be used after sex without contraception in order to prevent an unwanted
pregnancy.[12] In the United States, levonorgestrel (LNG) Plan B One Step and other generics (the morning
after pill or emergency contraception) can be acquired by persons of any age.[12] When taken within 72
hours of sex without contraception, Plan B and generics can help prevent an unwanted pregnancy.[12]
Clinical practice and unintended pregnancy prevention
Other options for emergency contraception in the United States include ulipristal acetate (available with a
prescription) taken within five days of sex without contraception, and the insertion of a copper IUD within
five days of sex without contraception.[12]
