Paranasal sinuses
Paranasal sinuses are a group of four paired air-filled
spaces that surround the nasal cavity.[1] The maxillary
sinuses are located under the eyes; the frontal sinuses
are above the eyes; the ethmoidal sinuses are between
the eyes and the sphenoidal sinuses are behind the eyes.
The sinuses are named for the facial bones and
sphenoid bone in which they are located. Their role is
disputed.
Humans possess four pairs of paranasal sinuses, divided
into subgroups that are named according to the bones
within which the sinuses lie. They are all innervated by
branches of the trigeminal nerve (CN V).
The maxillary sinuses, the largest of the
paranasal sinuses, are under the eyes, in the
maxillary bones (open in the back of the
semilunar hiatus of the nose). They are
innervated by the maxillary nerve (CN V2).[2]
The frontal sinuses, superior to the eyes, in
the frontal bone, which forms the hard part of
the forehead. They are innervated by the
ophthalmic nerve (CN V1).[2]
The ethmoidal sinuses, which are formed from
several discrete air cells within the ethmoid
bone between the nose and the eyes. They
are innervated by the ethmoidal nerves, which
branch from the nasociliary nerve of the
ophthalmic nerve (CN V1).
The sphenoidal sinuses, in the sphenoid
bone. They are innervated by the ophthalmic
and maxillary nerve (CN V1 and V2).[2]
The paranasal sinuses are lined with respiratory
epithelium 
(ciliated 
pseudostratified 
columnar
epithelium).

Anatomical terminology
One known function of the paranasal sinuses is the
production of nitric oxide, which also functions as a
facilitator of oxygen uptake.[3]
Paranasal sinuses form developmentally through
excavation of bone by air-filled sacs (pneumatic
diverticula) from the nasal cavity. This process begins
prenatally (intrauterine life), and it continues through
the course of an organism's lifetime.
The results of experimental studies suggest that the
natural ventilation rate of a sinus with a single sinus ostium (opening) is extremely slow. Such limited
ventilation may be protective for the sinus, as it would help prevent drying of its mucosal surface and
maintain a near-sterile environment with high carbon dioxide concentrations and minimal pathogen access.
Thus composition of gas content in the maxillary sinus is similar to venous blood, with high carbon dioxide
and lower oxygen levels compared to breathing air.[4]
Development
At birth, only the maxillary sinus and the ethmoid sinus are developed but not yet pneumatized; only by the
age of seven they are fully aerated. The sphenoid sinus appears at the age of three, and the frontal sinuses
first appear at the age of six, and fully develop during adulthood.[5]

The paranasal sinuses are joined to the nasal cavity via small orifices called ostia. These become blocked
easily by allergic inflammation, or by swelling in the nasal lining that occurs with a cold. If this happens,
normal drainage of mucus within the sinuses is disrupted, and sinusitis may occur. Because the maxillary
posterior teeth are close to the maxillary sinus, this can also cause clinical problems if any disease processes
are present, such as an infection in any of these teeth. These clinical problems can include secondary
sinusitis, the inflammation of the sinuses from another source such as an infection of the adjacent teeth.[6]
These conditions may be treated with drugs such as decongestants, which cause vasoconstriction in the
sinuses; reducing inflammation; by traditional techniques of nasal irrigation; or by corticosteroid.

Cancer
Malignancies of the paranasal sinuses comprise approximately 0.2% of all malignancies. About 80% of
these malignancies arise in the maxillary sinus. Men are much more often affected than women. They most
often occur in the age group between 40 and 70 years. Carcinomas are more frequent than sarcomas.
Metastases are rare. Tumours of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses are extremely rare.
Sinus is a Latin word meaning a fold, curve, or bay. Compare sine.
Paranasal sinuses occur in many other animals, including most mammals, birds, non-avian dinosaurs, and
crocodilians. The bones occupied by sinuses are quite variable in these other species.
