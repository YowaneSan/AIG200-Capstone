Anatomical terminology
Nostril
A nostril (or naris /ˈnɛərɪs/, pl.: nares /ˈnɛəriːz/) is either of the
two orifices of the nose. They enable the entry and exit of air
and other gasses through the nasal cavities. In birds and
mammals, they contain branched bones or cartilages called
turbinates, whose function is to warm air on inhalation and
remove moisture on exhalation. Fish do not breathe through
noses, but they do have two small holes used for smelling,
which can also be referred to as nostrils (with the exception of
Cyclostomi, which have just one nostril).
In humans, the nasal cycle is the normal ultradian cycle of each
nostril's blood vessels becoming engorged in swelling, then
shrinking.
The nostrils are separated by the septum. The septum can
sometimes be deviated, causing one nostril to appear larger than
the other. With extreme damage to the septum and columella,
the two nostrils are no longer separated and form a single larger
external opening.
Like other tetrapods, humans have two external nostrils
(anterior nares) and two additional nostrils at the back of the
nasal cavity, inside the head (posterior nares, posterior nasal
apertures or choanae). They also connect the nose to the throat
(the nasopharynx), aiding in respiration. Though all four
nostrils were on the outside of the head of the aquatic ancestors
of modern tetrapods, the nostrils for outgoing water (excurrent
nostrils) migrated to the inside of the mouth, as evidenced by
the discovery of Kenichthys campbelli, a 395-million-year-old
fossilized fish which shows this migration in progress. It has
two nostrils between its front teeth, similar to human embryos at
an early stage. If these fail to join up, the result is a cleft
palate.[1]
Each external nostril contains approximately 1,000 strands of
nasal hair, which function to filter foreign particles such as
pollen and dust.[2]
It is possible for humans to smell different olfactory inputs in the two nostrils and experience a perceptual
rivalry akin to that of binocular rivalry when there are two different inputs to the two eyes.[3] Furthermore,
scent information from the two nostrils leads to two types of neural activity[4] with the first cycle
corresponding to the ipsilateral and the second cycle corresponding to the contralateral odor representations.
The Procellariiformes are distinguished from other birds by having tubular extensions of their nostrils.
Widely-spaced nostrils, like those of the hammerhead shark, may be useful in determining the direction of
an odour's source.[5][6]
