Pharynx
The pharynx (pl.: pharynges) is the part of the throat behind
the mouth and nasal cavity, and above the esophagus and
trachea (the tubes going down to the stomach and the lungs
respectively). It is found in vertebrates and invertebrates,
though its structure varies across species. The pharynx carries
food to the esophagus and air to the larynx. The flap of
cartilage called the epiglottis stops food from entering the
larynx.
In humans, the pharynx is part of the digestive system and the
conducting zone of the respiratory system. (The conducting
zone—which also includes the nostrils of the nose, the larynx,
trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles—filters, warms and moistens
air and conducts it into the lungs).[1] The human pharynx is
conventionally divided into three sections: the nasopharynx,
oropharynx, and laryngopharynx.
In humans, two sets of pharyngeal muscles form the pharynx
and determine the shape of its lumen. They are arranged as an
inner layer of longitudinal muscles and an outer circular layer.
The upper portion of the pharynx, the nasopharynx, extends
from the base of the skull to the upper surface of the soft
palate.[2] It includes the space between the internal nares and
the soft palate and lies above the oral cavity. The adenoids, also
known as the pharyngeal tonsils, are lymphoid tissue structures
located in the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. Waldeyer's
tonsillar ring is an annular arrangement of lymphoid tissue in
both the nasopharynx and oropharynx. The nasopharynx is
lined by respiratory epithelium that is pseudostratified,
columnar, and ciliated.
Polyps or mucus can obstruct the nasopharynx, as can
congestion due to an upper respiratory infection. The auditory
tube, which connects the middle ear to the pharynx, opens into
the nasopharynx at the pharyngeal opening of the auditory tube.

Details of torus tubarius
The opening and closing of the auditory tubes serves to
equalize the barometric pressure in the middle ear with that of
the ambient atmosphere.
The anterior aspect of the nasopharynx communicates through
the choanae with the nasal cavities. On its lateral wall is the
pharyngeal opening of the auditory tube, somewhat triangular
in shape and bounded behind by a firm prominence, the torus
tubarius or cushion, caused by the medial end of the cartilage of
the tube that elevates the mucous membrane. Two folds arise
from the cartilaginous opening:
the salpingopharyngeal fold, a vertical fold of
mucous membrane extending from the inferior part of
the torus and containing the salpingopharyngeus
muscle
the salpingopalatine fold, a smaller fold, in front of
the salpingopharyngeal fold, extending from the
superior part of the torus to the palate and containing
the levator veli palatini muscle. It also contains some
muscle fibres called salpingopalatine muscle[3] The
tensor veli palatini is lateral to the levator and does
not contribute to the fold, since the origin is deep to the
cartilaginous opening.
The oropharynx lies behind the oral cavity, extending from the
uvula to the level of the hyoid bone. It opens anteriorly, through the
isthmus faucium, into the mouth, while in its lateral wall, between
the palatoglossal arch and the palatopharyngeal arch, is the palatine
tonsil.[4] The anterior wall consists of the base of the tongue and the
epiglottic vallecula; the lateral wall is made up of the tonsil, tonsillar
fossa, and tonsillar (faucial) pillars; the superior wall consists of the
inferior surface of the soft palate and the uvula. Because both food
and air pass through the pharynx, a flap of connective tissue called
the epiglottis closes over the glottis when food is swallowed to
prevent aspiration. The oropharynx is lined by non-keratinized
squamous stratified epithelium.
The

organisms 
(Haemophilus, 
Actinobacillus

Cardiobacterium 
hominis, 
Eikenella
corrodens, Kingella) are part of the normal oropharyngeal flora,
which grow slowly, prefer a carbon dioxide-enriched atmosphere,
and share an enhanced capacity to produce endocardial infections,
especially in young children.[5] Fusobacterium is a pathogen.[6]
Oropharynx
Laryngopharynx
Pharyngitis is the painful swelling of
the throat. The oropharynx shown
here is very inflamed and red.
The laryngopharynx, (Latin: pars laryngea pharyngis), also known as hypopharynx, is the caudal part of
the pharynx; it is the part of the throat that connects to the esophagus. It lies inferior to the epiglottis and
extends to the location where this common pathway diverges into the respiratory (laryngeal) and digestive
(esophageal) pathways. At that point, the laryngopharynx is continuous with the esophagus posteriorly. The
esophagus conducts food and fluids to the stomach; air enters the larynx anteriorly. During swallowing,
food has the "right of way", and air passage temporarily stops. Corresponding roughly to the area located
between the 4th and 6th cervical vertebrae, the superior boundary of the laryngopharynx is at the level of
the hyoid bone. The laryngopharynx includes three major sites: the pyriform sinus, postcricoid area, and the
posterior pharyngeal wall. Like the oropharynx above it, the laryngopharynx serves as a passageway for
food and air and is lined with a stratified squamous epithelium. It is innervated by the pharyngeal plexus
and by the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
The vascular supply to the laryngopharynx includes the superior thyroid artery, the lingual artery and the
ascending pharyngeal artery. The primary neural supply is from both the vagus and glossopharyngeal
nerves. The vagus nerve provides an auricular branch also termed "Arnold's nerve" which also supplies the
external auditory canal, thus laryngopharyngeal cancer can result in referred ear pain. This nerve is also
responsible for the ear-cough reflex in which stimulation of the ear canal results in a person coughing.
The pharynx moves food from the mouth to the esophagus. It also moves air from the nasal and oral cavities
to the larynx. It is also used in human speech, as pharyngeal consonants are articulated here, and it acts as a
resonating chamber during phonation.
Inflammation of the pharynx, or pharyngitis, is the painful
inflammation of the throat.
Pharyngeal cancer is a cancer that originates in the neck and/or
throat.
Waldeyer's tonsillar ring is an anatomical term collectively describing the annular arrangement of lymphoid
tissue in the pharynx. Waldeyer's ring circumscribes the naso- and oropharynx, with some of its tonsillar
tissue located above and some below the soft palate (and to the back of the oral cavity). It is believed that
Waldeyer's ring prevents the invasion of microorganisms from going into the air and food passages and this
helps in the defense mechanism of the respiratory and alimentary systems.[7]

Etymology
An illustration of the pharyngeal
jaws of a moray eel
The word pharynx (/ˈfærɪŋks/[8][9]) is derived from the Greek φάρυγξ phárynx, meaning "throat". Its plural
form is pharynges /fəˈrɪndʒiːz/ or pharynxes /ˈfærɪŋksəz/, and its adjective form is pharyngeal
(/ˌfærɪnˈdʒiːəl/ or /fəˈrɪndʒiəl/).
All vertebrates have a pharynx, used in both feeding and respiration. The pharynx arises during
development in all vertebrates through a series of six or more outpocketings on the lateral sides of the head.
These outpocketings are pharyngeal arches, and they give rise to a number of different structures in the
skeletal, muscular, and circulatory systems. The structure of the pharynx varies across the vertebrates. It
differs in dogs, horses, and ruminants. In dogs, a single duct connects the nasopharynx to the nasal cavity.
The tonsils are a compact mass that points away from the lumen of the pharynx. In the horse, the auditory
tube opens into the guttural pouch and the tonsils are diffuse and raised slightly. Horses are unable to
breathe through the mouth as the free apex of the rostral epiglottis lies dorsal to the soft palate in a normal
horse. In ruminants the tonsils are a compact mass that points towards the lumen of the pharynx.
Pharyngeal arches are characteristic features of vertebrates whose origin can be traced back through
chordates to basal deuterostomes who also share endodermal outpocketings of the pharyngeal apparatus.
Similar patterns of gene expression can be detected in the developing pharynx of amphioxi and
hemichordates. However, the vertebrate pharynx is unique in that it gives rise to endoskeletal support
through the contribution of neural crest cells.[10]
Pharyngeal jaws are a "second set" of jaws contained within the
pharynx of many species of fish, distinct from the primary (oral) jaws.
Pharyngeal jaws have been studied in moray eels where their specific
action is noted. When the moray bites prey, it first bites normally with
its oral jaws, capturing the prey. Immediately thereafter, the pharyngeal
jaws are brought forward and bite down on the prey to grip it; they
then retract, pulling the prey down the eel's esophagus, allowing it to
be swallowed.[11]
Invertebrates also have a pharynx. Invertebrates with a pharynx
include the tardigrades,[12] annelids and arthropods,[13] and the priapulids (which have an eversible
pharynx).[14]
The "pharynx" of the nematode worm is a muscular food pump in the head, triangular in cross-section, that
grinds food and transports it directly to the intestines. A one-way valve connects the pharynx to the
excretory canal.
