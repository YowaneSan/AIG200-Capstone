Early B cell development: from stem
cell to immature B cell
B cell
B cells, also known as B lymphocytes, are a type of white
blood cell of the lymphocyte subtype.[1] They function in the
humoral immunity component of the adaptive immune
system.[1] B cells produce antibody molecules which may be
either secreted or inserted into the plasma membrane where
they serve as a part of B-cell receptors.[2] When a na√Øve or
memory B cell is activated by an antigen, it proliferates and
differentiates into an antibody-secreting effector cell, known as
a plasmablast or plasma cell.[2] In addition, B cells present
antigens (they are also classified as professional antigen-
presenting cells, APCs) and secrete cytokines.[1] In mammals,
including marsupials [3] B cells mature in the bone marrow,
which is at the core of most bones.[4] In birds, B cells mature in
the bursa of Fabricius, a lymphoid organ where they were first
discovered by Chang and Glick,[5] which is why the B stands
for bursa and not bone marrow, as commonly believed.
B cells, unlike the other two classes of lymphocytes, T cells and
natural killer cells, express B cell receptors (BCRs) on their cell
membrane.[1] BCRs allow the B cell to bind to a foreign
antigen, against which it will initiate an antibody response.[1] B
cell receptors are extremely specific, with all BCRs on a B cell
recognizing the same epitope.[6]
B cells develop from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that originate
from bone marrow.[7][8] HSCs first differentiate into multipotent
progenitor (MPP) cells, then common lymphoid progenitor (CLP)
cells.[8] From here, their development into B cells occurs in several stages (shown in image to the right),
each marked by various gene expression patterns and immunoglobulin H chain and L chain gene loci
arrangements, the latter due to B cells undergoing V(D)J recombination as they develop.[9]
B cells undergo two types of selection while developing in the bone marrow to ensure proper development,
both involving B cell receptors (BCR) on the surface of the cell. Positive selection occurs through antigen-
independent signalling involving both the pre-BCR and the BCR.[10][11] If these receptors do not bind to
Development
Transitional B cell development: from
immature B cell to MZ B cell or
mature (FO) B cell
B cell activation: from immature B
cell to plasma cell or memory B cell
Basic B cell function: bind to an
antigen, receive help from a cognate
helper T cell, and differentiate into a
plasma cell that secretes large
amounts of antibodies
their ligand, B cells do not receive the proper signals and cease to
develop.[10][11] Negative selection occurs through the binding of
self-antigen with the BCR; if the BCR can bind strongly to self-
antigen, then the B cell undergoes one of four fates: clonal deletion,
receptor editing, anergy, or ignorance (B cell ignores signal and
continues development).[11] This negative selection process leads to
a state of central tolerance, in which the mature B cells do not bind
self antigens present in the bone marrow.[9]
To complete development, immature B cells migrate from the bone
marrow into the spleen as transitional B cells, passing through two
transitional stages: T1 and T2.[12] Throughout their migration to the
spleen and after spleen entry, they are considered T1 B cells.[13]
Within the spleen, T1 B cells transition to T2 B cells.[13] T2 B cells differentiate into either follicular (FO)
B cells or marginal zone (MZ) B cells depending on signals received through the BCR and other
receptors.[14] Once differentiated, they are now considered mature B cells, or naive B cells.[13]
B cell activation occurs in
the 
secondary 
lymphoid
organs (SLOs), such as the
spleen and lymph nodes.[1]
After B cells mature in the
bone marrow, they migrate
through the blood to SLOs,
which receive a constant
supply of antigen through
circulating lymph.[15] At the
SLO, B cell activation begins when the B cell binds to an antigen via its BCR.[16] Although the events
taking place immediately after activation have yet to be completely determined, it is believed that B cells are
activated in accordance with the kinetic segregation model , initially determined in T lymphocytes. This
model denotes that before antigen stimulation, receptors diffuse through the membrane coming into contact
with Lck and CD45 in equal frequency, rendering a net equilibrium of phosphorylation and non-
phosphorylation. It is only when the cell comes in contact with an antigen presenting cell that the larger
CD45 is displaced due to the close distance between the two membranes. This allows for net
phosphorylation of the BCR and the initiation of the signal transduction pathway. Of the three B cell
subsets, FO B cells preferentially undergo T cell-dependent activation while MZ B cells and B1 B cells
preferentially undergo T cell-independent activation.[17]
Activation
T-dependent B cell activation
B cell activation is enhanced through the activity of CD21, a surface receptor in complex with surface
proteins CD19 and CD81 (all three are collectively known as the B cell coreceptor complex).[18] When a
BCR binds an antigen tagged with a fragment of the C3 complement protein, CD21 binds the C3 fragment,
co-ligates with the bound BCR, and signals are transduced through CD19 and CD81 to lower the activation
threshold of the cell.[19]
Antigens that activate B cells with the help of T-cell are known as T cell-dependent (TD) antigens and
include foreign proteins.[1] They are named as such because they are unable to induce a humoral response
in organisms that lack T cells.[1] B cell responses to these antigens takes multiple days, though antibodies
generated have a higher affinity and are more functionally versatile than those generated from T cell-
independent activation.[1]
Once a BCR binds a TD antigen, the antigen is taken up into the B cell through receptor-mediated
endocytosis, degraded, and presented to T cells as peptide pieces in complex with MHC-II molecules on the
cell membrane.[20] T helper (TH) cells, typically follicular T helper (TFH) cells recognize and bind these
MHC-II-peptide complexes through their T cell receptor (TCR).[21] Following TCR-MHC-II-peptide
binding, T cells express the surface protein CD40L as well as cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-21.[21] CD40L
serves as a necessary co-stimulatory factor for B cell activation by binding the B cell surface receptor
CD40, which promotes B cell proliferation, immunoglobulin class switching, and somatic hypermutation as
well as sustains T cell growth and differentiation.[1] T cell-derived cytokines bound by B cell cytokine
receptors also promote B cell proliferation, immunoglobulin class switching, and somatic hypermutation as
well as guide differentiation.[21] After B cells receive these signals, they are considered activated.[21]
Once activated, B cells participate in a two-step differentiation
process that yields both short-lived plasmablasts for immediate
protection and long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells for
persistent protection.[17] The first step, known as the extrafollicular
response, occurs outside lymphoid follicles but still in the SLO.[17]
During this step activated B cells proliferate, may undergo
immunoglobulin class switching, and differentiate into plasmablasts
that produce early, weak antibodies mostly of class IgM.[22]
The second step consists of activated B cells entering a lymphoid
follicle and forming a germinal center (GC), which is a specialized
microenvironment where B cells undergo extensive proliferation, immunoglobulin class switching, and
affinity maturation directed by somatic hypermutation.[23] These processes are facilitated by TFH cells
within the GC and generate both high-affinity memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells.[17] Resultant
plasma cells secrete large amounts of antibody and either stay within the SLO or, more preferentially,
migrate to bone marrow.[23]
Antigens that activate B cells without T cell help are known as T cell-independent (TI) antigens[1] and
include foreign polysaccharides and unmethylated CpG DNA.[17] They are named as such because they
are able to induce a humoral response in organisms that lack T cells.[1] B cell response to these antigens is

rapid, though antibodies generated tend to have lower affinity and
are less functionally versatile than those generated from T cell-
dependent activation.[1]
As with TD antigens, B cells activated by TI antigens need
additional signals to complete activation, but instead of receiving
them from T cells, they are provided either by recognition and
binding of a common microbial constituent to toll-like receptors
(TLRs) or by extensive crosslinking of BCRs to repeated epitopes
on a bacterial cell.[1] B cells activated by TI antigens go on to
proliferate outside lymphoid follicles but still in SLOs (GCs do not
form), possibly undergo immunoglobulin class switching, and
differentiate into short-lived plasmablasts that produce early, weak
antibodies mostly of class IgM, but also some populations of long-lived plasma cells.[24]
Memory B cell activation begins with the detection and binding of their target antigen, which is shared by
their parent B cell.[25] Some memory B cells can be activated without T cell help, such as certain virus-
specific memory B cells, but others need T cell help.[26] Upon antigen binding, the memory B cell takes up
the antigen through receptor-mediated endocytosis, degrades it, and presents it to T cells as peptide pieces in
complex with MHC-II molecules on the cell membrane.[25] Memory T helper (TH) cells, typically memory
follicular T helper (TFH) cells, that were derived from T cells activated with the same antigen recognize and
bind these MHC-II-peptide complexes through their TCR.[25] Following TCR-MHC-II-peptide binding
and the relay of other signals from the memory TFH cell, the memory B cell is activated and differentiates
either into plasmablasts and plasma cells via an extrafollicular response or enter a germinal center reaction
where they generate plasma cells and more memory B cells.[25][26] It is unclear whether the memory B cells
undergo further affinity maturation within these secondary GCs.[25] In vitro activation of memory B cells
can be achieved through stimulation with various activators, such as pokeweed mitogen or anti-CD40
monoclonal antibodies, however, a study found a combination of R-848 and recombinant human IL-2 to be
the most efficient activator.[27]
Plasmablast
A short-lived, proliferating antibody-secreting cell
arising from B cell differentiation.[1] Plasmablasts are
generated early in an infection and their antibodies
tend to have a weaker affinity towards their target
antigen compared to plasma cell.[17] Plasmablasts can
result from T cell-independent activation of B cells or
the extrafollicular response from T cell-dependent
activation of B cells.[1]
Plasma cell
A long-lived, non-proliferating antibody-secreting cell
arising from B cell differentiation.[1] There is evidence that B cells first differentiate into a
plasmablast-like cell, then differentiate into a plasma cell.[17] Plasma cells are generated
later in an infection and, compared to plasmablasts, have antibodies with a higher affinity
Memory B cell activation
B cell types
towards their target antigen due to affinity maturation in the germinal center (GC) and
produce more antibodies.[17] Plasma cells typically result from the germinal center reaction
from T cell-dependent activation of B cells, though they can also result from T cell-
independent activation of B cells.[24]
Lymphoplasmacytoid cell
A cell with a mixture of B lymphocyte and plasma cell morphological features that is
thought to be closely related to or a subtype of plasma cells. This cell type is found in pre-
malignant and malignant plasma cell dyscrasias that are associated with the secretion of
IgM monoclonal proteins; these dyscrasias include IgM monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance and Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia.[28]
Memory B cell
Dormant B cell arising from B cell differentiation.[1] Their function is to circulate through the
body and initiate a stronger, more rapid antibody response (known as the anamnestic
secondary antibody response) if they detect the antigen that had activated their parent B
cell (memory B cells and their parent B cells share the same BCR, thus they detect the
same antigen).[26] Memory B cells can be generated from T cell-dependent activation
through both the extrafollicular response and the germinal center reaction as well as from
T cell-independent activation of B1 cells.[26]
B-2 cell
FO B cells and MZ B cells.[29]
Follicular (FO) B cell (also known as a B-2 cell)
Most common type of B cell and, when not circulating through the blood, is found
mainly in the lymphoid follicles of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs).[17] They are
responsible for generating the majority of high-affinity antibodies during an
infection.[1]
Marginal-zone (MZ) B cell
Found mainly in the marginal zone of the spleen and serves as a first line of defense
against blood-borne pathogens, as the marginal zone receives large amounts of
blood from the general circulation.[30] They can undergo both T cell-independent and
T cell-dependent activation, but preferentially undergo T cell-independent
activation.[17]
B-1 cell
Arises from a developmental pathway different from FO B cells and MZ B cells.[29] In mice,
they predominantly populate the peritoneal cavity and pleural cavity, generate natural
antibodies (antibodies produced without infection), defend against mucosal pathogens,
and primarily exhibit T cell-independent activation.[29] A true homologue of mouse B-1
cells has not been discovered in humans, though various cell populations similar to B-1
cells have been described.[29]
Regulatory B (Breg) cell
An immunosuppressive B cell type that stops the expansion of pathogenic, pro-
inflammatory lymphocytes through the secretion of IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-Œ≤.[31] Also, it
promotes the generation of regulatory T (Treg) cells by directly interacting with T cells to
skew their differentiation towards Tregs.[31] No common Breg cell identity has been
described and many Breg cell subsets sharing regulatory functions have been found in
both mice and humans.[31] It is currently unknown if Breg cell subsets are developmentally
linked and how exactly differentiation into a Breg cell occurs.[31] There is evidence
showing that nearly all B cell types can differentiate into a Breg cell through mechanisms
involving inflammatory signals and BCR recognition.[31]
B cell-related pathology
Autoimmune disease can result from abnormal B cell recognition of self-antigens followed by the
production of autoantibodies.[32] Autoimmune diseases where disease activity is correlated with B cell
activity include scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, post-
infectious IBS, and rheumatoid arthritis.[32]
Malignant transformation of B cells and their precursors can cause a host of cancers, including chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), hairy cell leukemia, follicular
lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and plasma cell malignancies such as
multiple myeloma, Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia, and certain forms of amyloidosis.[33][34]
Abnormal B cells may be relatively large and some diseases include this in their names, such as diffuse
large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) and intravascular large B-cell lymphoma.
Patients with B cell alymphocytosis are predisposed to infections.[35]
A study that investigated the methylome of B cells along their differentiation cycle, using whole-genome
bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), showed that there is a hypomethylation from the earliest stages to the most
differentiated stages. The largest methylation difference is between the stages of germinal center B cells and
memory B cells. Furthermore, this study showed that there is a similarity between B cell tumors and long-
lived B cells in their DNA methylation signatures.[36]
