Blood plasma
Blood plasma is a light amber-colored liquid component of blood
in which blood cells are absent, but which contains proteins and
other constituents of whole blood in suspension. It makes up about
55% of the body's total blood volume.[1] It is the intravascular part
of extracellular fluid (all body fluid outside cells). It is mostly water
(up to 95% by volume), and contains important dissolved proteins
(6–8%; e.g., serum albumins, globulins, and fibrinogen),[2] glucose,
clotting factors, electrolytes (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3
−, Cl−, etc.),
hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for
excretory product transportation), and oxygen.[3] It plays a vital role
in an intravascular osmotic effect that keeps electrolyte
concentration balanced and protects the body from infection and
other blood-related disorders.[4]
Blood plasma is separated from the blood by blood fractionation
containing an anticoagulant in a centrifuge until the blood cells fall
to the bottom of the tube. The blood plasma is then poured or
drawn off.[5] For point-of-care testing applications, plasma can be extracted from whole blood via
filtration[6] or via agglutination[7] to allow for rapid testing of specific biomarkers. Blood plasma has a
density of approximately 1,025  kg/m3 (1.025  g/ml).[8] Blood serum is blood plasma without clotting
factors.[5] Plasmapheresis is a medical therapy that involves blood plasma extraction, treatment, and
reintegration.
Fresh frozen plasma is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications
needed in a basic health system.[9] It is of critical importance in the treatment of many types of trauma
which result in blood loss, and is therefore kept stocked universally in all medical facilities capable of
treating trauma (e.g., trauma centers, hospitals, and ambulances) or that pose a risk of patient blood loss
such as surgical suite facilities [10]

Blood plasma volume may be expanded by or drained to extravascular fluid when there are changes in
Starling forces across capillary walls. For example, when blood pressure drops in circulatory shock, Starling
forces drive fluid into the interstitium, causing third spacing.[11]
Standing still for a prolonged period will cause an increase in transcapillary hydrostatic pressure. As a result,
approximately 12% of blood plasma volume will cross into the extravascular compartment. This plasma
shift causes an increase in hematocrit, serum total protein, blood viscosity and, as a result of increased
concentration of coagulation factors, it causes orthostatic hypercoagulability.[12]
Serum albumins are the most common plasma proteins, and they are responsible for maintaining the osmotic
pressure of the blood. Without albumins, the consistency of blood would be closer to that of water. The
increased viscosity of blood prevents fluid from entering the bloodstream from outside the capillaries.
Albumins are produced in the liver, assuming the absence of a hepatocellular deficiency.[13]
The second most common type of protein in the blood plasma are globulins. Important globulins include
immunoglobins which are important for the immune system and transport hormones and other compounds
around the body. There are three main types of globulins. Alpha-1 and Alpha-2 globulins are formed in the
liver and play an important role in mineral transport and the inhibition of blood coagulation.[14] An example
of beta globulin found in blood plasma includes low-density lipoproteins (LDL) which are responsible for
transporting fat to the cells for steroid and membrane synthesis.[15] Gamma globulin, better known as
immunoglobulins, are produced by plasma B cells, and provides the human body with a defense system
against invading pathogens and other immune diseases.[16]
Fibrinogen proteins make up most of the remaining proteins in the blood. Fibrinogens are responsible for
clotting blood to help prevent blood loss.[17]
Plasma is normally yellow due to bilirubin,
carotenoids, hemoglobin, and transferrin.[18] In
abnormal cases, plasma can have varying
shades of orange, green, or brown. The green
color can be due to ceruloplasmin or
sulfhemoglobin. The latter may form due to
medicines that are able to form sulfonamides
once ingested.[19] A dark brown or reddish
color can appear due to hemolysis, in which
methemoglobin is released from broken blood

cells.[20] Plasma is normally relatively transparent, but sometimes it can be opaque. Opaqueness is typically
due to elevated content of lipids like cholesterol and triglycerides.[21]
Blood plasma and blood serum are often used in blood tests. Tests can be done on plasma, serum or
both.[22] In addition, some tests have to be done with whole blood, such as the determination of the amount
of blood cells in blood via flow cytometry.[23]
Some of the benefits of plasma over
serum
Some of the benefits of serum over plasma
Plasma preparation is quick, as it is not
coagulated. Serum sample preparation
requires about 30 minutes of waiting time
before it can be centrifuged and then
analyzed.[22] However, coagulation can be
hastened down to a few minutes by adding
thrombin or similar agents to the serum
sample.[24]
Plasma preparation requires the addition of anticoagulants, which
can cause expected and unexpected measurement errors. For
example, anticoagulant salts can add extra cations like NH4
+, Li+,
Na+ and K+ to the sample,[22] or impurities like lead and
aluminum.[25] Chelator anticoagulants like EDTA and citrate salts
work by binding calcium (see carboxyglutamic acid), but they may
also bind other ions. Even if such ions are not the analytes,
chelators can interfere with enzyme activity measurements. For
example, EDTA binds zinc ions, which alkaline phosphatases need
as cofactors. Thus, phosphatase activity cannot be measured if
EDTA is used.[22]
Compared to serum, 15–20% larger volume
of plasma can be obtained from a blood
sample of certain size. Serum lacks some
proteins that partake in coagulation and
increase the sample volume.[22]
An unknown volume of anticoagulants can be added to a plasma
sample by accident, which may ruin the sample as the analyte
concentration is changed by an unknown amount.[25]
Serum preparation can cause measurement
errors by increasing or decreasing the
concentration of the analyte that is meant to
be measured. For example, during
coagulation, blood cells consume blood
glucose and platelets increase the sample
content of compounds like potassium,
phosphates and aspartate transaminase by
secreting them. Glucose or these other
compounds may be the analytes.[22]
No anticoagulants are added to serum samples, which decreases
the preparation cost of the samples relative to plasma samples.[25]
Plasma samples can form tiny clots if the added anticoagulant is
not properly mixed with the sample. Non-uniform samples can
cause measurement errors.[25]
Plasma was already well known when described by William Harvey in de Motu Cordis in 1628, but
knowledge of it probably dates as far back as Vesalius (1514–1564). The discovery of fibrinogen by
William Henson, c. 1770,[26] made it easier to study plasma, as ordinarily, upon coming in contact with a
foreign surface – something other than the vascular endothelium – clotting factors become activated and
clotting proceeds rapidly, trapping RBCs etc. in the plasma and preventing separation of plasma from the
blood. Adding citrate and other anticoagulants is a relatively recent advance. Upon the formation of a clot,
the remaining clear fluid (if any) is blood serum, which is essentially plasma without the clotting factors[27]

History
Private Roy W. Humphrey is being
given blood plasma after he was
wounded by shrapnel in Sicily in
August 1943.
Dried plasma packages used by the
British and US militaries during WWII
The use of blood plasma as a substitute for whole blood and for
transfusion purposes was proposed in March 1918, in the
correspondence columns of the British Medical Journal, by Gordon
R. Ward. "Dried plasmas" in powder or strips of material format
were developed and first used in World War II. Prior to the United
States' involvement in the war, liquid plasma and whole blood were
used. [28]
Dr. José Antonio Grifols Lucas, a scientist from Vilanova i la
Geltrú, Spain,[29] founded Laboratorios Grifols in 1940.[30] Dr.
Grifols 
pioneered 
a 
first-of-its-kind 
technique 
called
plasmapheresis,[30] where a donor's red blood cells would be
returned to the donor's body almost immediately after the separation
of the blood plasma. This technique is still in practice today, almost
80 years later. In 1945, Dr. Grifols opened the world's first plasma
donation center.[29] Thirteen years after the center's opening, Dr.
Grifols unexpectedly died at the young age of 41 due to leukemia.
The "Blood for Britain" program during the early 1940s was quite
successful (and popular in the United States) based on Charles
Drew's contribution. A large project began in August 1940 to
collect blood in New York City hospitals for the export of plasma to
Britain. Drew was appointed medical supervisor of the "Plasma for
Britain" project. His notable contribution at this time was to
transform the test tube methods of many blood researchers into the
first successful mass production techniques.[31]
Nevertheless, the decision was made to develop a dried plasma
package for the armed forces as it would reduce breakage and make
the transportation, packaging, and storage much simpler.[32] The
resulting dried plasma package came in two tin cans containing 400 cc bottles. One bottle contained enough
distilled water to reconstitute the dried plasma contained within the other bottle. In about three minutes, the
plasma would be ready to use and could stay fresh for around four hours. The Blood for Britain program
operated successfully for five months, with total collections of almost 15,000 people donating blood, and
with over 5,500 vials of blood plasma.[33]
Following the Supplying Blood Plasma to England project, Drew was named director of the Red Cross
blood bank and assistant director of the National Research Council, in charge of blood collection for the
United States Army and Navy. Drew argued against the armed forces directive that blood/plasma was to be
separated by the race of the donor. Drew insisted that there was no racial difference in human blood and
that the policy would lead to needless deaths as soldiers and sailors were required to wait for "same race"
blood.[34]

A machine being used for plasma
donation
By the end of the war the American Red Cross had provided enough blood for over six million plasma
packages. Most of the surplus plasma was returned to the United States for civilian use. Serum albumin
replaced dried plasma for combat use during the Korean War.[32]
Plasma as a blood product prepared from blood donations is used in
blood transfusions, typically as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or Plasma
Frozen within 24 hours after phlebotomy (PF24). When donating
whole blood or packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions, O- is
the most desirable and is considered a "universal donor," since it
has neither A nor B antigens and can be safely transfused to most
recipients. Type AB+ is the "universal recipient" type for PRBC
donations. However, for plasma the situation is somewhat reversed.
Blood donation centers will sometimes collect only plasma from
AB donors through apheresis, as their plasma does not contain the
antibodies that may cross react with recipient antigens. As such, AB
is often considered the "universal donor" for plasma. Special
programs exist just to cater to the male AB plasma donor, because
of concerns about transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI)
and female donors who may have higher leukocyte antibodies.[35]
However, some studies show an increased risk of TRALI despite
increased leukocyte antibodies in women who have been pregnant.[36]
Following fears of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) being spread through the blood supply, the
British government began to phase out blood plasma from U.K. donors and by the end of 1999 had
imported all blood products made with plasma from the United States.[37] In 2002, the British government
purchased Life Resources Incorporated, an American blood supply company, to import plasma.[38] The
company became Plasma Resources UK (PRUK) which owned Bio Products Laboratory. In 2013, the
British government sold an 80% stake in PRUK to American hedge fund Bain Capital, in a deal estimated
to be worth £200 million. The sale was met with criticism in the UK.[39] In 2009, the U.K. stopped
importing plasma from the United States, as it was no longer a viable option due to regulatory and
jurisdictional challenges.[40]
At present (2024), blood donated in the United Kingdom is used by UK Blood Services for the
manufacture of plasma blood components (Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate). However,
plasma from UK donors is still not used for the commercial manufacture of fractionated plasma
medicines.[41]
