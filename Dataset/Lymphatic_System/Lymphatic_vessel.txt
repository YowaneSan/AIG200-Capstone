Lymphatic vessel
The lymphatic vessels (or lymph vessels or lymphatics) are
thin-walled vessels (tubes), structured like blood vessels, that
carry lymph. As part of the lymphatic system, lymph vessels are
complementary to the cardiovascular system. Lymph vessels are
lined by endothelial cells, and have a thin layer of smooth
muscle, and adventitia that binds the lymph vessels to the
surrounding tissue. Lymph vessels are devoted to the
propulsion of the lymph from the lymph capillaries, which are
mainly concerned with the absorption of interstitial fluid from
the tissues. Lymph capillaries are slightly bigger than their
counterpart capillaries of the vascular system. Lymph vessels
that carry lymph to a lymph node are called afferent lymph
vessels, and those that carry it from a lymph node are called
efferent lymph vessels, from where the lymph may travel to
another lymph node, may be returned to a vein, or may travel to
a larger lymph duct. Lymph ducts drain the lymph into one of
the subclavian veins and thus return it to general circulation.
The vessels that bring lymph away from the tissues and towards
the lymph nodes can be classified as afferent vessels. These
afferent vessels then drain into the subcapsular sinus.[1] The
efferent vessels that bring lymph from the lymphatic organs to
the nodes bringing the lymph to the right lymphatic duct or the
thoracic duct, the largest lymph vessel in the body. These
vessels drain into the right and left subclavian veins,
respectively. There are far more afferent vessels bringing in
lymph than efferent vessels taking it out to allow for
lymphocytes and macrophages to fulfill their immune support
functions. The lymphatic vessels contain valves.
The general structure of lymphatics is based on that of blood
vessels. There is an inner lining of single flattened epithelial
cells (simple squamous epithelium) composed of a type of
epithelium that is called the endothelium, and the cells are
called endothelial cells. This layer functions to mechanically
transport fluid and since the basement membrane on which it
rests is discontinuous; it leaks easily.[2] The next layer is that of
smooth muscles that are arranged in a circular fashion around
the endothelium, which by shortening (contracting) or relaxing
alter the diameter (caliber) of the lumen. The outermost layer is

Anatomical terminology

the adventitia which consists of fibrous tissue. The general
structure described here is seen only in larger lymphatics;
smaller lymphatics have fewer layers. The smallest vessels
(lymphatic or lymph capillaries) lack both the muscular layer
and the outer adventitia. As they proceed forward and in their
course are joined by other capillaries, they grow larger and first
take on an adventitia, and then smooth muscles.
The lymphatic conducting system broadly consists of two types
of channels—the initial lymphatics, the prelymphatics or lymph
capillaries that specialize in collection of the lymph from the
interstital fluid, and the larger lymph vessels that propel the
lymph forward.
Unlike the cardiovascular system, the lymphatic system is not
closed and has no central pump. Lymph movement occurs
despite low pressure due to peristalsis (propulsion of the lymph
due to alternate contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle),
valves, and compression during contraction of adjacent skeletal
muscle and arterial pulsation.[3]
The lymphatic circulation begins with blind ending (closed at
one end) highly permeable superficial lymph capillaries, formed
by endothelial cells with button-like junctions between them
that allow fluid to pass through them when the interstitial
pressure is sufficiently high.[4] These button-like junctions
consist of protein filaments like platelet endothelial cell
adhesion molecule-1, or PECAM-1. A valve system in place
here prevents the absorbed lymph from leaking back into the
interstital fluid. This valve system involves collagen fibers
attached to lymphatic endothelial cells that respond to
increased interstitial fluid pressure by separating the
endothelial cells and allowing the flow of lymph into the
capillary for circulation.[5] There is another system of
semilunar valves that prevents back-flow of lymph along the
lumen of the vessel.[4] Lymph capillaries have many interconnections (anastomoses) between them and
form a very fine network.[6]
Rhythmic contraction of the vessel walls through movements may also help draw fluid into the smallest
lymphatic vessels, capillaries. If tissue fluid builds up the tissue will swell; this is called edema. As the
circular path through the body's system continues, the fluid is then transported to progressively larger
lymphatic vessels culminating in the right lymphatic duct (for lymph from the right upper body) and the

thoracic duct (for the rest of the body); both ducts drain into the
circulatory system at the right and left subclavian veins. The system
collaborates with white blood cells in lymph nodes to protect the body
from being infected by cancer cells, fungi, viruses or bacteria. This is
known as a secondary circulatory system.
The lymph capillaries drain into larger collecting lymphatics. These are
contractile lymphatics which transport lymph using a combination of
smooth muscle walls, which contract to assist in transporting lymph, as
well as valves to prevent the lymph from flowing backwards.[3] As the
collecting lymph vessel accumulates lymph from more and more
lymph capillaries along its length, it becomes larger and eventually
becomes an afferent lymph vessel as it enters a lymphs node. The
lymph percolates through the lymph node tissue and exits via an
efferent lymph vessel. An efferent lymph vessel may directly drain into
one of the (right or thoracic) lymph ducts, or may empty into another
lymph node as its afferent lymph vessel.[6] Both the lymph ducts return
the lymph to the blood stream by emptying into the subclavian veins
Lymph vessels consist of functional units known as lymphangions
which are segments separated by semilunar valves. These segments
propel or resist the flow of lymph by the contraction of the encircling smooth muscle depending upon the
ratio of its length to its radius.[7]
Lymph vessels act as reservoirs for plasma and other substances including cells that have leaked from the
vascular system and transport lymph fluid back from the tissues to the circulatory system. Without
functioning lymph vessels, lymph cannot be effectively drained and lymphedema typically results.
The afferent lymph vessels enter at all parts of the periphery of the lymph node, and after branching and
forming a dense plexus in the substance of the capsule, open into the lymph sinuses of the cortical part. It
carries unfiltered lymph into the node. In doing this they lose all their coats except their endothelial lining,
which is continuous with a layer of similar cells lining the lymph paths.
Afferent lymphatic vessels are only found in lymph nodes. This is in contrast to efferent lymphatic vessel
which are also found in the thymus and spleen.
The efferent lymphatic vessel commences from the lymph sinuses of the medullary portion of the lymph
nodes and leave the lymph nodes at the hilum, either to veins or greater nodes. It carries filtered lymph out
of the node.

Efferent lymphatic vessels are also found in association with the thymus and spleen. This is in contrast to
afferent lymphatic vessels, which are found only in association with lymph nodes.
Lymphedema is the swelling of tissues due to insufficient fluid drainage by the lymphatic vessels. It can be
the result from absent, underdeveloped or dysfunctional lymphatic vessels. In hereditary (or primary)
lymphedema, the lymphatic vessels are absent, underdeveloped or dysfunctional due to genetic causes. In
acquired (or secondary) lymphedema, the lymphatic vessels are damaged by injury or infection.[8][9]
Lymphangiomatosis is a disease involving multiple cysts or lesions formed from lymphatic vessels.
