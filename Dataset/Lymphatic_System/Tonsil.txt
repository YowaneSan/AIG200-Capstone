Tonsil
The tonsils are a set of lymphoid organs facing into the
aerodigestive tract, which is known as Waldeyer's tonsillar ring
and consists of the adenoid tonsil (or pharyngeal tonsil), two
tubal tonsils, two palatine tonsils, and the lingual tonsils. These
organs play an important role in the immune system.
When used unqualified, the term most commonly refers
specifically to the palatine tonsils, which are two lymphoid
organs situated at either side of the back of the human throat.
The palatine tonsils and the adenoid tonsil are organs consisting
of lymphoepithelial tissue located near the oropharynx and
nasopharynx (parts of the throat).
Humans are born with four types of tonsils: the pharyngeal
tonsil, two tubal tonsils, two palatine tonsils and the lingual
tonsils.[1]

The palatine tonsils tend to reach their largest size in puberty, and they gradually undergo atrophy thereafter.
However, they are largest relative to the diameter of the throat in young children. In adults, each palatine
tonsil normally measures up to 2.5 cm in length, 2.0 cm in width and 1.2 cm in thickness.[5]
The adenoid grows until the age of 5, starts to shrink at the age of 7 and becomes small in adulthood.
The tonsils are immunocompetent organs that serve as the immune system's first line of defense against
ingested or inhaled foreign pathogens, and as such frequently engorge with blood to assist in immune
responses to common illnesses such as the common cold. The tonsils have on their surface specialized
antigen capture cells called microfold cells (M cells) that allow for the uptake of antigens produced by
pathogens. These M cells then alert the B cells and T cells in the tonsil that a pathogen is present and an
immune response is stimulated.[6] B cells are activated and proliferate in areas called germinal centers in the
tonsil. These germinal centers are places where B memory cells are created and secretory antibody (IgA) is
produced.
The palatine tonsils can become enlarged (adenotonsillar hyperplasia) or inflamed (tonsillitis). The most
common way to treat tonsillitis is with anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, or if bacterial in origin,
antibiotics, e.g. amoxicillin and azithromycin. Surgical removal (tonsillectomy) may be advised if the tonsils
obstruct the airway or interfere with swallowing, or in patients with severe or recurrent tonsillitis.[7]
However, different mechanisms of pathogenesis for these two subtypes of tonsillar hypertrophy have been
described,[8] and may have different responses to identical therapeutic efforts. In older patients, asymmetric
tonsils (also known as asymmetric tonsil hypertrophy) may be an indicator of virally infected tonsils, or
tumors such as lymphoma or squamous cell carcinoma.
A tonsillolith (also known as a "tonsil stone") is material that accumulates on the palatine tonsil. This can
reach the size of a blueberry and is white or cream in color. The main substance is mostly calcium, but it has
a strong unpleasant odor because of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan and other chemicals.[9]

Palatine tonsil enlargement can affect speech, making it hypernasal
and giving it the sound of velopharyngeal incompetence (when
space in the mouth is not fully separated from the nose's air
space).[10] Tonsil size may have a more significant impact on upper
airway obstruction for obese children than for those of average
weight.[11]
As mucosal lymphatic tissue of the aerodigestive tract, the palatine
tonsils are viewed in some classifications as belonging to both the
gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and the mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue (MALT). Other viewpoints treat them (and the
spleen and thymus) as large lymphatic organs contradistinguished
from the smaller tissue loci of GALT and MALT.
