Urinary tract obstruction
Urinary tract obstruction is a urologic disease consisting of a
decrease in the free passage of urine through one or both ureters
and/or the urethra. It is a cause of urinary retention. Complete
obstruction of the urinary tract requires prompt treatment for renal
preservation.[1] Any sign of infection, such as fever and chills, in the context of obstruction to urine flow
constitutes a urologic emergency.[1]
Causes of urinary tract obstruction include:
Bladder stone and renal stone
Benign prostatic hyperplasia
Obstruction as a congenital disorder.
Foreign object such as a bullet or pellet.[2]
Urinary tract obstruction as a congenital disorder results in oligohydramnios which in turn can lead to the
Potter sequence of atypical physical appearance. Pulmonary hypoplasia is by far the main cause of death in
the early neonatal period for children with congenital lower urinary tract obstruction.[3]
Fetal surgery of congenital lower urinary tract obstruction seems to improve survival, according to a
randomized yet small study.[3]
Urinary tract obstruction due to foreign object
While uncommon, there are case reports in the human and veterinary literature of a bullet or other ballistic
projectile migrating to the urethra and causing a urinary tract obstruction. This has been reported in people,
small animals, and a goat.[4]
Causes
Congenital urinary tract obstruction
Sitting voiding position
A meta-analysis on the influence of voiding position on urodynamics in healthy males and males with
LUTS showed that in the sitting position, the residual urine in the bladder was significantly reduced. The
other parameters, namely the maximum urinary flow and the voiding time were increased and decreased
respectively. For healthy males, no influence was found on these parameters, meaning that they can urinate
in either position.[5]
Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the obstruction and the severity of the symptoms.
