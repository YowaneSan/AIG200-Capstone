Urinary meatus
The urinary meatus[a] (/miːˈeɪtəs/, mee-AY-təs; pl.: meatus or
meatuses), also known as the external urethral orifice, is the
opening where urine exits the male and female urethra. It is
where semen also exits the male urethra. The meatus has
varying degrees of sensitivity to touch.
The male external urethral orifice is the external opening of the
urethra, normally located at the tip of the glans penis,[1] at its
junction with the frenular delta. It presents as a vertical slit,
possibly bounded on either side by two small labia-like
projections, and continues longitudinally along the front aspect
of the glans, which facilitates the flow of urine micturition. In
some cases, the opening may be more rounded. This can occur
naturally or may also occur as a side effect of excessive skin removal during circumcision. The meatus is a
sensitive part of the male reproductive system.
The female external urethral orifice is the external opening of the
urethra, from which urine is ejected during urination. It is located
about 2.5 cm (1 in) behind the clitoris and immediately in front of
the vaginal opening in the vulval vestibule. It usually assumes the
form of a short, sagittal cleft with slightly raised margins. To its left
and right are the openings of the Skene's glands.
Some evidence exists to suggest that the clitoral-urinary meatus
distance (CUMD) in human females relates to the ease with which
the female may achieve orgasm through penetrative sex. Orgasm
from penetration alone is observed to be more likely as CUMD decreases.[2]
In human males
In human females
Evidence also suggests that decreased distance from the vaginal opening to the urethral meatus is associated
with recurrent post-coital urinary tract infections. [3] Surgical repositioning of the distal urethra to prevent
recurrent post-coital urinary tract infections has been employed with some success by Russian physicians.[4]
Unlike most other mammals (including human), female spotted hyenas have a urinary meatus that is located
on the clitoral glans.[5][6]
Congenital disorders of the meatus, in the male, include epispadias (the misplacement to the upper aspect)
and hypospadias (the misplacement to the underside of the penis). A congenital misshaping can result in its
narrowing (meatal stenosis), causing a partial or total urinary blockage or the bifurcation of the urinary
stream. A urethral blockage can also be caused by foreign material, kidney stones, or bladder stones
(lithiasis).

passing.
