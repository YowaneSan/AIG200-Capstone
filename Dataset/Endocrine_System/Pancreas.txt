Pancreas
The pancreas is an organ of the digestive system and
endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the
abdomen behind the stomach and functions as a gland. The
pancreas is a mixed or heterocrine gland, i.e., it has both an
endocrine and a digestive exocrine function.[2] 99% of the
pancreas is exocrine and 1% is endocrine.[3][4][5][6] As an
endocrine gland, it functions mostly to regulate blood sugar
levels, secreting the hormones insulin, glucagon, somatostatin
and pancreatic polypeptide. As a part of the digestive system, it
functions as an exocrine gland secreting pancreatic juice into
the duodenum through the pancreatic duct. This juice contains
bicarbonate, which neutralizes acid entering the duodenum
from the stomach; and digestive enzymes, which break down
carbohydrates, proteins and fats in food entering the duodenum
from the stomach.
Inflammation of the pancreas is known as pancreatitis, with
common causes including chronic alcohol use and gallstones.
Because of its role in the regulation of blood sugar, the pancreas
is also a key organ in diabetes mellitus. Pancreatic cancer can
arise following chronic pancreatitis or due to other reasons, and
carries a very poor prognosis, as it is often only identified after
it has spread to other areas of the body.
The word pancreas comes from the Greek πᾶν (pân, "all") &
κρέας (kréas, "flesh"). The function of the pancreas in diabetes
has been known since at least 1889, with its role in insulin
production identified in 1921.
The pancreas is an organ that in humans lies in the abdomen,
stretching from behind the stomach to the left upper abdomen
near the spleen. In adults, it is about 12–15 centimetres (4.7–
5.9 in) long, lobulated, and salmon-coloured in appearance.[7]
Anatomically, the pancreas is divided into a head, neck, body,
and tail. The pancreas stretches from the inner curvature of the
duodenum, where the head surrounds two blood vessels: the
superior mesenteric artery and vein. The longest part of the
pancreas, the body, stretches across behind the stomach, and the
tail of the pancreas ends adjacent to the spleen.[7]

Anatomical terminology
The pancreas (shown here in pink)
sits behind the stomach, with the
body near the curvature of the
duodenum, and the tail stretching to
touch the spleen.
Two ducts, the main pancreatic duct and a smaller accessory
pancreatic duct run through the body of the pancreas. The main
pancreatic duct joins with the common bile duct forming a
small ballooning called the ampulla of Vater (hepatopancreatic
ampulla). This ampulla is surrounded by a muscle, the sphincter
of Oddi. This ampulla opens into the descending part of the
duodenum. The opening of the common bile duct into main
pancreatic duct is controlled by sphincter of Boyden. The
accessory pancreatic duct opens into duodenum with separate
openings located above the opening of the main pancreatic
duct.[7]
The head of the pancreas sits within the curvature of the
duodenum, and wraps around the superior mesenteric artery
and vein. To the right sits the descending part of the duodenum,
and 
between 
these 
travel 
the 
superior 
and 
inferior
pancreaticoduodenal arteries. Behind rests the inferior vena
cava, and the common bile duct. In front sits the peritoneal
membrane and the transverse colon.[7] A small uncinate process
emerges from below the head, situated behind the superior
mesenteric vein and sometimes artery.[7]
The neck of the pancreas separates the head of the pancreas, located
in the curvature of the duodenum, from the body. The neck is about
2 cm (0.79 in) wide, and sits in front of where the portal vein is
formed. The neck lies mostly behind the pylorus of the stomach,
and 
is 
covered 
with 
peritoneum. 
The 
anterior 
superior
pancreaticoduodenal artery travels in front of the neck of the
pancreas.[7]
The body is the largest part of the pancreas, and mostly lies behind
the stomach, tapering along its length. The peritoneum sits on top of
the body of the pancreas, and the transverse colon in front of the
peritoneum.[7] Behind the pancreas are several blood vessels,
including the aorta, the splenic vein, and the left renal vein, as well
as the beginning of the superior mesenteric artery.[7] Below the
body of the pancreas sits some of the small intestine, specifically the
last part of the duodenum and the jejunum to which it connects, as
well as the suspensory ligament of the duodenum which falls
between these two. In front of the pancreas sits the transverse colon.[8]
Parts
This image shows a pancreatic islet
when pancreatic tissue is stained
and viewed under a microscope.
Parts of the digestive ("exocrine")
pancreas can be seen around the
islet, more darkly. These contain
hazy dark purple granules of inactive
digestive enzymes (zymogens).
The pancreas narrows towards the tail, which sits near to the spleen.[7] It is usually between 1.3–3.5 cm
(0.51–1.38 in) long, and sits between the layers of the ligament between the spleen and the left kidney. The
splenic artery and vein, which also passes behind the body of the pancreas, pass behind the tail of the
pancreas.[7]
The pancreas has a rich blood supply, with vessels originating as branches of both the coeliac artery and
superior mesenteric artery.[7] The splenic artery, the largest branch of the celiac trunk, runs along the top of
the pancreas, and supplies the left part of the body and the tail of the pancreas through its pancreatic
branches, the largest of which is called the greater pancreatic artery.[7] The superior and inferior
pancreaticoduodenal arteries run along the back and front surfaces of the head of the pancreas adjacent to
the duodenum. These supply the head of the pancreas. These vessels join together (anastamose) in the
middle.[7]
The body and neck of the pancreas drain into the splenic vein, which sits behind the pancreas.[7] The head
drains into, and wraps around, the superior mesenteric and portal veins, via the pancreaticoduodenal
veins.[7]
The pancreas drains into lymphatic vessels that travel alongside its arteries, and has a rich lymphatic
supply.[7] The lymphatic vessels of the body and tail drain into splenic lymph nodes, and eventually into
lymph nodes that lie in front of the aorta, between the coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries. The
lymphatic vessels of the head and neck drain into intermediate lymphatic vessels around the
pancreaticoduodenal, mesenteric and hepatic arteries, and from there into the lymph nodes that lie in front of
the aorta.[7]
The pancreas contains tissue with an endocrine and exocrine role,
and this division is also visible when the pancreas is viewed under a
microscope.[10]
The majority of pancreatic tissue has a digestive role. The cells with
this role form clusters (Latin: acini) around small ducts, and are
arranged in lobes that have thin fibrous walls. The cells of each
acinus secrete inactive digestive enzymes called zymogens into the
small intercalated ducts which they surround. In each acinus, the
cells are pyramid-shaped and situated around the intercalated ducts,
with the nuclei resting on the basement membrane, a large
endoplasmic reticulum, and a number of zymogen granules visible
within the cytoplasm. The intercalated ducts drain into larger
intralobular ducts within the lobule, and finally interlobular ducts.
The ducts are lined by a single layer of column-shaped cells. There
is more than one layer of cells as the diameter of the ducts
increases.[10]
Blood supply
Microanatomy
A pancreatic islet that uses
fluorescent antibodies to show the
location of different cell types in the
pancreatic islet. Antibodies against
glucagon, secreted by alpha cells,
show their peripheral position.
Antibodies against insulin, secreted
by beta cells, show the more
widespread and central position that
these cells tend to have.[9]
The tissues with an endocrine role within the pancreas exist as
clusters of cells called pancreatic islets (also called islets of
Langerhans) that are distributed throughout the pancreas.[9]
Pancreatic islets contain alpha cells, beta cells, and delta cells, each
of which releases a different hormone. These cells have
characteristic positions, with alpha cells (secreting glucagon)
tending to be situated around the periphery of the islet, and beta
cells (secreting insulin) more numerous and found throughout the
islet.[9] Enterochromaffin cells are also scattered throughout the
islets.[9] Islets are composed of up to 3,000 secretory cells, and
contain several small arterioles to receive blood, and venules that
allow the hormones secreted by the cells to enter the systemic
circulation.[9]
The size of the pancreas varies considerably.[7] Several anatomical
variations exist, relating to the embryological development of the
two pancreatic buds. The pancreas develops from these buds on
either side of the duodenum. The ventral bud rotates to lie next to the dorsal bud, eventually fusing. In about
10% of adults, an accessory pancreatic duct may be present if the main duct of the dorsal bud of the
pancreas does not regress; this duct opens into the minor duodenal papilla.[11] If the two buds themselves,
each having a duct, do not fuse, a pancreas may exist with two separate ducts, a condition known as a
pancreas divisum. This condition has no physiologic consequence.[12] If the ventral bud does not fully
rotate, an annular pancreas may exist, where part or all of the duodenum is encircled by the pancreas. This
may be associated with duodenal atresia.[13]
10,000 protein coding genes (~50% of all human genes) are expressed in the normal human
pancreas.[14][15] Less than 100 of these genes are specifically expressed in the pancreas. Similar to the
salivary glands, most pancreas-specific genes encode for secreted proteins. Corresponding pancreas-specific
proteins are either expressed in the exocrine cellular compartment and have functions related to digestion or
food uptake such as digestive chymotrypsinogen enzymes and pancreatic lipase PNLIP, or are expressed in
the various cells of the endocrine pancreatic islets and have functions related to secreted hormones such as
insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide.[16]
The pancreas forms during development from two buds that arise from the duodenal part of the foregut, an
embryonic tube that is a precursor to the gastrointestinal tract.[11] It is of endodermal origin.[11] Pancreatic
development begins with the formation of a dorsal and ventral pancreatic bud. Each joins with the foregut
through a duct. The dorsal pancreatic bud forms the neck, body, and tail of the developed pancreas, and the
ventral pancreatic bud forms the head and uncinate process.[11]
Variation
Gene and protein expression
Development
The pancreas originates from the foregut, a
precursor tube to part of the digestive tract, as a
dorsal and ventral bud. As it develops, the ventral
bud rotates to the other side and the two buds fuse
together.
The definitive pancreas results from rotation of the
ventral bud and the fusion of the two buds.[11] During
development, the duodenum rotates to the right, and
the ventral bud rotates with it, moving to a position that
becomes more dorsal. Upon reaching its final
destination, the ventral pancreatic bud is below the
larger dorsal bud, and eventually fuses with it. At this
point of fusion, the main ducts of the ventral and dorsal
pancreatic buds fuse, forming the main pancreatic duct.
Usually, the duct of the dorsal bud regresses, leaving
the main pancreatic duct.[11]
Pancreatic progenitor cells are precursor cells that
differentiate into the functional pancreatic cells,
including exocrine acinar cells, endocrine islet cells,
and ductal cells.[17] These progenitor cells are characterised by the co-expression of the transcription factors
PDX1 and NKX6-1.[17]
The cells of the exocrine pancreas differentiate through molecules that induce differentiation including
follistatin, fibroblast growth factors, and activation of the Notch receptor system.[17] Development of the
exocrine acini progresses through three successive stages. These are the predifferentiated,
protodifferentiated, and differentiated stages, which correspond to undetectable, low, and high levels of
digestive enzyme activity, respectively.[17]
Pancreatic progenitor cells differentiate into endocrine islet cells under the influence of neurogenin-3 and
ISL1, but only in the absence of notch receptor signaling. Under the direction of a Pax gene, the endocrine
precursor cells differentiate to form alpha and gamma cells. Under the direction of Pax-6, the endocrine
precursor cells differentiate to form beta and delta cells.[17] The pancreatic islets form as the endocrine cells
migrate from the duct system to form small clusters around capillaries.[9] This occurs around the third month
of development,[11] and insulin and glucagon can be detected in the human fetal circulation by the fourth or
fifth month of development.[17]
The pancreas is involved in blood sugar control and metabolism within the body, and also in the secretion
of substances (collectively pancreatic juice) that help digestion. These are divided into an "endocrine" role,
relating to the secretion of insulin and other substances within pancreatic islets that help control blood sugar
levels and metabolism within the body, and an "exocrine" role, relating to the secretion of enzymes
involved in digesting substances in the digestive tract.[10]
Cells within the pancreas help to maintain blood glucose levels (homeostasis). The cells that do this are
located within the pancreatic islets that are present throughout the pancreas. When blood glucose levels are
low, alpha cells secrete glucagon, which increases blood glucose levels. When blood glucose levels are high
Cellular development
Function
Blood glucose regulation
The pancreas maintains constant
blood glucose levels (shown as the
waving line). When the blood glucose
level is too high, the pancreas
secretes insulin and when the level
is too low, the pancreas secretes
glucagon.
The pancreas has a role in digestion,
highlighted here. Ducts in the
pancreas (green) conduct digestive
enzymes into the duodenum. This
image also shows a pancreatic islet,
part of the endocrine pancreas,
which contains cells responsible for
secretion of insulin and glucagon.
beta cells secrete insulin to decrease glucose in blood. Delta cells in
the islet also secrete somatostatin which decreases the release of
insulin and glucagon.[9]
Glucagon acts to increase glucose levels by promoting the creation
of glucose and the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in the liver. It
also decreases the uptake of glucose in fat and muscle. Glucagon
release is stimulated by low blood glucose or insulin levels, and
during exercise.[18] Insulin acts to decrease blood glucose levels by
facilitating uptake by cells (particularly skeletal muscle), and
promoting its use in the creation of proteins, fats and carbohydrates.
Insulin is initially created as a precursor form called preproinsulin.
This is converted to proinsulin and cleaved by C-peptide to insulin
which is then stored in granules in beta cells. Glucose is taken into
the beta cells and degraded. The end effect of this is to cause
depolarisation of the cell membrane which stimulates the release of the insulin.[18]
The main factor influencing the secretion of insulin and glucagon are the levels of glucose in blood
plasma.[19] Low blood sugar stimulates glucagon release, and high blood sugar stimulates insulin release.
Other factors also influence the secretion of these hormones. Some amino acids, that are byproducts of the
digestion of protein, stimulate insulin and glucagon release. Somatostatin acts as an inhibitor of both insulin
and glucagon. The autonomic nervous system also plays a role. Activation of Beta-2 receptors of the
sympathetic nervous system by catecholamines secreted from sympathetic nerves stimulates secretion of
insulin and glucagon,[19][20] whereas activation of Alpha-1 receptors inhibits secretion.[19] M3 receptors of
the parasympathetic nervous system act when stimulated by the right vagus nerve to stimulate release of
insulin from beta cells.[19]
The pancreas plays a vital role in the digestive system. It does this
by secreting a fluid that contains digestive enzymes into the
duodenum, the first part of the small intestine that receives food
from the stomach. These enzymes help to break down
carbohydrates, proteins and lipids (fats). This role is called the
"exocrine" role of the pancreas. The cells that do this are arranged
in clusters called acini. Secretions into the middle of the acinus
accumulate in intralobular ducts, which drain to the main pancreatic
duct, which drains directly into the duodenum. About 1.5 - 3 liters
of fluid are secreted in this manner every day.[8][21]
The cells in each acinus are filled with granules containing the
digestive enzymes. These are secreted in an inactive form termed
zymogens or proenzymes. When released into the duodenum, they
are activated by the enzyme enterokinase present in the lining of the
duodenum. The proenzymes are cleaved, creating a cascade of activating enzymes.[21]
Enzymes that break down proteins begin with activation of trypsinogen to trypsin. The free
trypsin then cleaves the rest of the trypsinogen, as well as chymotrypsinogen to its active
Digestion
form chymotrypsin.[21]
Enzymes secreted involved in the digestion of fats include lipase, phospholipase A2,
lysophospholipase, and cholesterol esterase.[21]
Enzymes that break down starch and other carbohydrates include amylase.[21]
These enzymes are secreted in a fluid rich in bicarbonate. Bicarbonate helps maintain an alkaline pH for the
fluid, a pH in which most of the enzymes act most efficiently, and also helps to neutralise the stomach acids
that enter the duodenum.[21] Secretion is influenced by hormones including secretin, cholecystokinin, and
VIP, as well as acetylcholine stimulation from the vagus nerve. Secretin is released from the S cells which
form part of the lining of the duodenum in response to stimulation by gastric acid. Along with VIP, it
increases the secretion of enzymes and bicarbonate. Cholecystokinin is released from Ito cells of the lining
of the duodenum and jejunum mostly in response to long chain fatty acids, and increases the effects of
secretin.[21] At a cellular level, bicarbonate is secreted from centroacinar and ductal cells through a sodium
and bicarbonate cotransporter that acts because of membrane depolarisation caused by the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator. Secretin and VIP act to increase the opening of the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator, which leads to more membrane depolarisation and more secretion of
bicarbonate.[22][23][24]
A variety of mechanisms act to ensure that the digestive action of the pancreas does not act to digest
pancreatic tissue itself. These include the secretion of inactive enzymes (zymogens), the secretion of the
protective enzyme trypsin inhibitor, which inactivates trypsin, the changes in pH that occur with bicarbonate
secretion that stimulate digestion only when the pancreas is stimulated, and the fact that the low calcium
within cells causes inactivation of trypsin.[21]
The pancreas also secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide and pancreatic polypeptide. Enterochromaffin cells
of the pancreas secrete the hormones motilin, serotonin, and substance P.[9]
Inflammation of the pancreas is known as pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is most often associated with recurrent
gallstones or chronic alcohol use, with other common causes including traumatic damage, damage
following an ERCP, some medications, infections such as mumps and very high blood triglyceride levels.
Acute pancreatitis is likely to cause intense pain in the central abdomen, that often radiates to the back, and
may be associated with nausea or vomiting. Severe pancreatitis may lead to bleeding or perforation of the
pancreas resulting in shock or a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, bruising of the flanks or the
region around the belly button. These severe complications are often managed in an intensive care unit.[25]
In pancreatitis, enzymes of the exocrine pancreas damage the structure and tissue of the pancreas. Detection
of some of these enzymes, such as amylase and lipase in the blood, along with symptoms and findings on
medical imaging such as ultrasound or a CT scan, are often used to indicate that a person has pancreatitis.
Pancreatitis is often managed medically with pain relief, and monitoring to prevent or manage shock, and

Clinical significance
Inflammation
Pancreatic cancer, shown here, most
commonly occurs as an
adenocarcinoma in the head of the
pancreas. Because symptoms (such
as skin yellowing, pain, or itch) do
not occur until later in the disease, it
often presents at a later stage and
has limited treatment options.

management of any identified underlying causes. This may include removal of gallstones, lowering of
blood triglyceride or glucose levels, the use of corticosteroids for autoimmune pancreatitis, and the cessation
of any medication triggers.[25]
Chronic pancreatitis refers to the development of pancreatitis over time. It shares many similar causes, with
the most common being chronic alcohol use, with other causes including recurrent acute episodes and cystic
fibrosis. Abdominal pain, characteristically relieved by sitting forward or drinking alcohol, is the most
common symptom. When the digestive function of the pancreas is severely affected, this may lead to
problems with fat digestion and the development of steatorrhoea; when the endocrine function is affected,
this may lead to diabetes. Chronic pancreatitis is investigated in a similar way to acute pancreatitis. In
addition to management of pain and nausea, and management of any identified causes (which may include
alcohol cessation), because of the digestive role of the pancreas, enzyme replacement may be needed to
prevent malabsorption.[25]
Pancreatic cancers, particularly the most common type, pancreatic
adenocarcinoma, remain very difficult to treat, and are mostly
diagnosed only at a stage that is too late for surgery, which is the
only curative treatment. Pancreatic cancer is rare in people younger
than 40 and the median age of diagnosis is 71.[27] Risk factors
include chronic pancreatitis, older age, smoking, obesity, diabetes,
and certain rare genetic conditions including multiple endocrine
neoplasia type 1, hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer and
dysplastic nevus syndrome among others.[25][28] About 25% of
cases are attributable to tobacco smoking,[29] while 5–10% of cases
are linked to inherited genes.[27]
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the most common form of pancreatic
cancer, and is cancer arising from the exocrine digestive part of the
pancreas. Most occur in the head of the
pancreas.[25] Symptoms tend to arise late in the
course of the cancer, when it causes abdominal
pain, weight loss, or yellowing of the skin
(jaundice). Jaundice occurs when the outflow
of bile is blocked by the cancer. Other less
common symptoms include nausea, vomiting,
pancreatitis, diabetes or recurrent venous
thrombosis.[25] Pancreatic cancer is usually
diagnosed by medical imaging in the form of
an ultrasound or CT scan with contrast
enhancement. An endoscopic ultrasound may
be used if a tumour is being considered for
surgical removal, and biopsy guided by ERCP
or ultrasound can be used to confirm an uncertain diagnosis.[25]
Cancer
Because of the late development of symptoms, most cancer presents at an advanced stage.[25] Only 10 to
15% of tumours are suitable for surgical resection.[25] As of 2018, when chemotherapy is given the
FOLFIRINOX regimen containing fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and leucovorin has been shown to
extend survival beyond traditional gemcitabine regimens.[25] For the most part, treatment is palliative, focus
on the management of symptoms that develop. This may include management of itch, a
choledochojejunostomy or the insertion of stents with ERCP to facilitate the drainage of bile, and
medications to help control pain.[25] In the United States pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause
of deaths due to cancer.[30] The disease occurs more often in the developed world, which had 68% of new
cases in 2012.[31] Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has poor outcomes with the average percentage
alive for at least one and five years after diagnosis being 25% and 5% respectively.[31][32] In localized
disease where the cancer is small (< 2 cm) the number alive at five years is approximately 20%.[33]
There are several types of pancreatic cancer, involving both the endocrine and exocrine tissue. The many
types of pancreatic endocrine tumors are all uncommon or rare, and have varied outlooks. However the
incidence of these cancers has been rising sharply; it is not clear to what extent this reflects increased
detection, especially through medical imaging, of tumors that would be very slow to develop. Insulinomas
(largely benign) and gastrinomas are the most common types.[34] For those with neuroendocrine cancers the
number alive after five years is much better at 65%, varying considerably with type.[31]
A solid pseudopapillary tumour is a low-grade malignant tumour of the pancreas of papillary architecture
that typically afflicts young women.[35]
Diabetes mellitus type 1 is a chronic autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the insulin-
secreting beta cells of the pancreas.[36] Insulin is needed to keep blood sugar levels within optimal ranges,
and its lack can lead to high blood sugar. As an untreated chronic condition, complications including
accelerated vascular disease, diabetic retinopathy, kidney disease and neuropathy can result.[36] In addition,
if there is not enough insulin for glucose to be used within cells, the medical emergency diabetic
ketoacidosis, which is often the first symptom that a person with type 1 diabetes may have, can result.[37]
Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age but is most often diagnosed before age 40.[36] For people living
with type 1 diabetes, insulin injections are critical for survival.[36] An experimental procedure to treat type 1
diabetes is pancreas transplantation or isolated transplantation of islet cells to supply a person with
functioning beta cells.[36]
Diabetes mellitus type 2 is the most common form of diabetes.[36] The causes for high blood sugar in this
form of diabetes usually are a combination of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, with both
genetic and environmental factors playing a role in the development of the disease.[38] Over time,
pancreatic beta cells may become "exhausted" and less functional.[36] The management of type 2 diabetes
involves a combination of lifestyle measures, medications if required and potentially insulin.[39] With
relevance to the pancreas, several medications act to enhance the secretion of insulin from beta cells,
Diabetes mellitus
Type 1 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes
particularly sulphonylureas, which act directly on beta cells; incretins which replicate the action of the
hormones glucagon-like peptide 1, increasing the secretion of insulin from beta cells after meals, and are
more resistant to breakdown; and DPP-4 inhibitors, which slow the breakdown of incretins.[39]
It is possible for a person to live without a pancreas, provided that the person takes insulin for proper
regulation of blood glucose concentration and pancreatic enzyme supplements to aid digestion.[40]
The pancreas was first identified by Herophilus (335–280 BC), a Greek anatomist and surgeon.[41] A few
hundred years later, Rufus of Ephesus, another Greek anatomist, gave the pancreas its name.
Etymologically, the term "pancreas", a modern Latin adaptation of Greek πάγκρεας,[42] [πᾶν ("all",
"whole"), and κρέας ("flesh")],[43] originally means sweetbread,[44] although literally meaning all-flesh,
presumably because of its fleshy consistency. It was only in 1889 when Oskar Minkowski discovered that
removing the pancreas from a dog caused it to become diabetic.[45] Insulin was later isolated from
pancreatic islets by Frederick Banting and Charles Best in 1921.[45]
The way the tissue of the pancreas has been viewed has also changed. Previously, it was viewed using
simple staining methods such as H&E stains. Now, immunohistochemistry can be used to more easily
differentiate cell types. This involves visible antibodies to the products of certain cell types, and helps
identify with greater ease cell types such as alpha and beta cells.[9]
Pancreatic tissue is present in all vertebrates, but its precise form and arrangement varies widely. There may
be up to three separate pancreases, two of which arise from the pancreatic bud, and the other dorsally. In
most species (including humans), these "fuse" in the adult, but there are several exceptions. Even when a
single pancreas is present, two or three pancreatic ducts may persist, each draining separately into the
duodenum (or equivalent part of the foregut). Birds, for example, typically have three such ducts.[46]
In teleost fish, and a few other species (such as rabbits), there is no discrete pancreas at all, with pancreatic
tissue being distributed diffusely across the mesentery and even within other nearby organs, such as the
liver or spleen. In a few teleost species, the endocrine tissue has fused to form a distinct gland within the
abdominal cavity, but otherwise it is distributed among the exocrine components. The most primitive
arrangement, however, appears to be that of lampreys and lungfish, in which pancreatic tissue is found as a
number of discrete nodules within the wall of the gut itself, with the exocrine portions being little different
from other glandular structures of the intestine.[46]
