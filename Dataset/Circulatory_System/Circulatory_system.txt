Circulatory system
The circulatory system is a system of organs that includes the
heart, blood vessels, and blood which is circulated throughout
the entire body of a human or other vertebrate.[1][2] It includes
the cardiovascular system, or vascular system, that consists
of the heart and blood vessels (from Greek kardia meaning
heart, and from Latin vascula meaning vessels). The circulatory
system has two divisions, a systemic circulation or circuit, and a
pulmonary circulation or circuit.[3] Some sources use the terms
cardiovascular system and vascular system interchangeably
with circulatory system.[4]
The network of blood vessels are the great vessels of the heart
including large elastic arteries, and large veins; other arteries,
smaller arterioles, capillaries that join with venules (small
veins), and other veins. The circulatory system is closed in
vertebrates, which means that the blood never leaves the
network of blood vessels. Some invertebrates such as
arthropods have an open circulatory system. Diploblasts such as
sponges, and comb jellies lack a circulatory system.
Blood is a fluid consisting of plasma, red blood cells, white
blood cells, and platelets; it is circulated around the body
carrying oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and collecting and
disposing of waste materials. Circulated nutrients include
proteins and minerals and other components include
hemoglobin, hormones, and gases such as oxygen and carbon
dioxide. These substances provide nourishment, help the
immune system to fight diseases, and help maintain homeostasis
by stabilizing temperature and natural pH.
In vertebrates, the lymphatic system is complementary to the
circulatory system. The lymphatic system carries excess plasma
(filtered from the circulatory system capillaries as interstitial
fluid between cells) away from the body tissues via accessory
routes that return excess fluid back to blood circulation as
lymph.[5] The lymphatic system is a subsystem that is essential
for the functioning of the blood circulatory system; without it
the blood would become depleted of fluid.
The lymphatic system also works with the immune system.[6]
The circulation of lymph takes much longer than that of
blood[7] and, unlike the closed (blood) circulatory system, the
Anatomical terminology

lymphatic system is an open system. Some sources describe it
as a secondary circulatory system.
The circulatory system can be affected by many cardiovascular diseases. Cardiologists are medical
professionals which specialise in the heart, and cardiothoracic surgeons specialise in operating on the heart
and its surrounding areas. Vascular surgeons focus on disorders of the blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels.
The circulatory system includes the heart,
blood 
vessels, 
and 
blood.[2] 
The
cardiovascular system in all vertebrates,
consists of the heart and blood vessels. The
circulatory system is further divided into two
major circuits – a pulmonary circulation, and a
systemic circulation.[8][1][3] The pulmonary
circulation is a circuit loop from the right heart
taking deoxygenated blood to the lungs where
it is oxygenated and returned to the left heart.
The systemic circulation is a circuit loop that
delivers oxygenated blood from the left heart to
the rest of the body, and returns deoxygenated
blood back to the right heart via large veins
known as the venae cavae. The systemic
circulation can also be defined as two parts – a macrocirculation and a microcirculation. An average adult
contains five to six quarts (roughly 4.7 to 5.7 liters) of blood, accounting for approximately 7% of their total
body weight.[9] Blood consists of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The digestive
system also works with the circulatory system to provide the nutrients the system needs to keep the heart
pumping.[10]
Further circulatory routes are associated, such as the coronary circulation to the heart itself, the cerebral
circulation to the brain, renal circulation to the kidneys, and bronchial circulation to the bronchi in the lungs.
The human circulatory system is closed, meaning that the blood is contained within the vascular
network.[11] Nutrients travel through tiny blood vessels of the microcirculation to reach organs.[11] The
lymphatic system is an essential subsystem of the circulatory system consisting of a network of lymphatic
vessels, lymph nodes, organs, tissues and circulating lymph. This subsystem is an open system.[12] A major
function is to carry the lymph, draining and returning interstitial fluid into the lymphatic ducts back to the
heart for return to the circulatory system. Another major function is working together with the immune
system to provide defense against pathogens.[13]
The heart pumps blood to all parts of the body providing nutrients and oxygen to every cell, and removing
waste products. The left heart pumps oxygenated blood returned from the lungs to the rest of the body in
the systemic circulation. The right heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs in the pulmonary
circulation. In the human heart there is one atrium and one ventricle for each circulation, and with both a
systemic and a pulmonary circulation there are four chambers in total: left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium

and right ventricle. The right atrium is the upper chamber of the
right side of the heart. The blood that is returned to the right atrium
is deoxygenated (poor in oxygen) and passed into the right ventricle
to be pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs for re-
oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide. The left atrium
receives newly oxygenated blood from the lungs as well as the
pulmonary vein which is passed into the strong left ventricle to be
pumped through the aorta to the different organs of the body.
The pulmonary circulation is the part of the circulatory system in
which oxygen-depleted blood is pumped
away from the heart, via the pulmonary
artery, 
to 
the 
lungs 
and 
returned,
oxygenated, to the heart via the pulmonary
vein.
Oxygen-deprived blood from the superior
and inferior vena cava enters the right
atrium of the heart and flows through the
tricuspid valve (right atrioventricular valve)
into the right ventricle, from which it is then
pumped through the pulmonary semilunar
valve into the pulmonary artery to the lungs.
Gas exchange occurs in the lungs, whereby
CO2 is released from the blood, and oxygen
is absorbed. The pulmonary vein returns the now oxygen-rich blood to the left atrium.[10]
A separate circuit from the systemic circulation, the bronchial circulation supplies blood to the tissue of the
larger airways of the lung.
The systemic circulation is a circuit loop that delivers
oxygenated blood from the left heart to the rest of the
body through the aorta. Deoxygenated blood is
returned in the systemic circulation to the right heart
via two large veins, the inferior vena cava and
superior vena cava, where it is pumped from the right
atrium 
into 
the 
pulmonary 
circulation 
for
oxygenation. The systemic circulation can also be
defined as having two parts – a macrocirculation and
a microcirculation.[10]

The blood vessels of the circulatory system are the arteries, veins,
and capillaries. The large arteries and veins that take blood to, and
away from the heart are known as the great vessels.[14]
Oxygenated blood enters the systemic circulation when leaving the
left ventricle, via the aortic semilunar valve.[15] The first part of the
systemic circulation is the aorta, a massive and thick-walled artery.
The aorta arches and gives branches supplying the upper part of the
body after passing through the aortic opening of the diaphragm at
the level of thoracic ten vertebra, it enters the abdomen.[16] Later, it
descends down and supplies branches to abdomen, pelvis,
perineum and the lower limbs.[17]
The walls of the aorta are elastic. This elasticity helps to maintain
the blood pressure throughout the body.[18] When the aorta receives
almost five litres of blood from the heart, it recoils and is
responsible for pulsating blood pressure. As the aorta branches into
smaller arteries, their elasticity goes on decreasing and their
compliance goes on increasing.[18]
Arteries branch into small passages called arterioles and then into
the capillaries.[19] The capillaries merge to bring blood into the
venous system.[20]
Capillaries merge into venules, which merge into veins.[21] The
venous system feeds into the two major veins: the superior vena cava – which mainly drains tissues above
the heart – and the inferior vena cava – which mainly drains tissues below the heart. These two large veins
empty into the right atrium of the heart.[22]
The general rule is that arteries from the heart branch out into capillaries, which collect into veins leading
back to the heart. Portal veins are a slight exception to this. In humans, the only significant example is the
hepatic portal vein which combines from capillaries around the gastrointestinal tract where the blood
absorbs the various products of digestion; rather than leading directly back to the heart, the hepatic portal
vein branches into a second capillary system in the liver.
The heart itself is supplied with oxygen and nutrients through a small "loop" of the systemic circulation and
derives very little from the blood contained within the four chambers. The coronary circulation system
provides a blood supply to the heart muscle itself. The coronary circulation begins near the origin of the

aorta by two coronary arteries: the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery. After nourishing the
heart muscle, blood returns through the coronary veins into the coronary sinus and from this one into the
right atrium. Backflow of blood through its opening during atrial systole is prevented by the Thebesian
valve. The smallest cardiac veins drain directly into the heart chambers.[10]
The brain has a dual blood supply, an anterior and a posterior circulation from arteries at its front and back.
The anterior circulation arises from the internal carotid arteries to supply the front of the brain. The posterior
circulation arises from the vertebral arteries, to supply the back of the brain and brainstem. The circulation
from the front and the back join (anastomise) at the circle of Willis. The neurovascular unit, composed of
various cells and vasculature channels within the brain, regulates the flow of blood to activated neurons in
order to satisfy their high energy demands.[23]
The renal circulation is the blood supply to the kidneys, contains many specialized blood vessels and
receives around 20% of the cardiac output. It branches from the abdominal aorta and returns blood to the
ascending inferior vena cava.
The development of the circulatory system starts with vasculogenesis in the embryo. The human arterial and
venous systems develop from different areas in the embryo. The arterial system develops mainly from the
aortic arches, six pairs of arches that develop on the upper part of the embryo. The venous system arises
from three bilateral veins during weeks 4 – 8 of embryogenesis. Fetal circulation begins within the 8th week
of development. Fetal circulation does not include the lungs, which are bypassed via the truncus arteriosus.
Before birth the fetus obtains oxygen (and nutrients) from the mother through the placenta and the umbilical
cord.[24]
The human arterial system originates from the aortic arches and from the dorsal aortae starting from week 4
of embryonic life. The first and second aortic arches regress and form only the maxillary arteries and
stapedial arteries respectively. The arterial system itself arises from aortic arches 3, 4 and 6 (aortic arch 5
completely regresses).
The dorsal aortae, present on the dorsal side of the embryo, are initially present on both sides of the embryo.
They later fuse to form the basis for the aorta itself. Approximately thirty smaller arteries branch from this at
the back and sides. These branches form the intercostal arteries, arteries of the arms and legs, lumbar arteries
and the lateral sacral arteries. Branches to the sides of the aorta will form the definitive renal, suprarenal and
gonadal arteries. Finally, branches at the front of the aorta consist of the vitelline arteries and umbilical
arteries. The vitelline arteries form the celiac, superior and inferior mesenteric arteries of the gastrointestinal
tract. After birth, the umbilical arteries will form the internal iliac arteries.

faster rate (~20 seconds of the
average 60-second cycle) and shows
the red blood cell deforming as it

The human venous system develops mainly from the vitelline veins,
the umbilical veins and the cardinal veins, all of which empty into
the sinus venosus.
About 98.5% of the oxygen in a sample of arterial blood in a
healthy human, breathing air at sea-level pressure, is chemically
combined with hemoglobin molecules. About 1.5% is physically
dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to
hemoglobin. The hemoglobin molecule is the primary transporter of
oxygen in vertebrates.
Many diseases affect the circulatory system. These include a
number of cardiovascular diseases, affecting the heart and blood
vessels; hematologic diseases that affect the blood, such as anemia,
and 
lymphatic 
diseases

system.
Cardiologists are medical professionals which specialise in the heart, and cardiothoracic surgeons specialise
in operating on the heart and its surrounding areas. Vascular surgeons focus on the blood vessels.
Diseases affecting the cardiovascular system are called cardiovascular disease.
Many of these diseases are called "lifestyle diseases" because they develop over time and are related to a
person's exercise habits, diet, whether they smoke, and other lifestyle choices a person makes.
Atherosclerosis is the precursor to many of these diseases. It is where small atheromatous plaques build up
in the walls of medium and large arteries. This may eventually grow or rupture to occlude the arteries. It is
also a risk factor for acute coronary syndromes, which are diseases that are characterised by a sudden deficit
of oxygenated blood to the heart tissue. Atherosclerosis is also associated with problems such as aneurysm
formation or splitting ("dissection") of arteries.
Another major cardiovascular disease involves the creation of a clot, called a "thrombus". These can
originate in veins or arteries. Deep venous thrombosis, which mostly occurs in the legs, is one cause of clots
in the veins of the legs, particularly when a person has been stationary for a long time. These clots may
embolise, meaning travel to another location in the body. The results of this may include pulmonary
embolus, transient ischaemic attacks, or stroke.
Cardiovascular diseases may also be congenital in nature, such as heart defects or persistent fetal circulation,
where the circulatory changes that are supposed to happen after birth do not. Not all congenital changes to
the circulatory system are associated with diseases, a large number are anatomical variations.

Investigations

The function and health of the circulatory system and its parts are
measured in a variety of manual and automated ways. These
include simple methods such as those that are part of the
cardiovascular examination, including the taking of a person's pulse
as an indicator of a person's heart rate, the taking of blood pressure
through a sphygmomanometer or the use of a stethoscope to listen
to the heart for murmurs which may indicate problems with the
heart's valves. An electrocardiogram can also be used to evaluate
the way in which electricity is conducted through the heart.
Other more invasive means can also be used. A cannula or catheter
inserted into an artery may be used to measure pulse pressure or
pulmonary wedge pressures. Angiography, which involves injecting
a dye into an artery to visualise an arterial tree, can be used in the
heart (coronary angiography) or brain. At the same time as the arteries are visualised, blockages or
narrowings may be fixed through the insertion of stents, and active bleeds may be managed by the insertion
of coils. An MRI may be used to image arteries, called an MRI angiogram. For evaluation of the blood
supply to the lungs a CT pulmonary angiogram may be used. Vascular ultrasonography may be used to
investigate vascular diseases affecting the venous system and the arterial system including the diagnosis of
stenosis, thrombosis or venous insufficiency. An intravascular ultrasound using a catheter is also an option.
There are a number of surgical procedures performed on the circulatory system:
Coronary artery bypass surgery
Coronary stent used in angioplasty
Vascular surgery
Vein stripping
Cosmetic procedures
Cardiovascular procedures are more likely to be performed in an inpatient setting than in an ambulatory care
setting; in the United States, only 28% of cardiovascular surgeries were performed in the ambulatory care
setting.[25]
While humans, as well as other vertebrates, have a closed blood circulatory system (meaning that the blood
never leaves the network of arteries, veins and capillaries), some invertebrate groups have an open
circulatory system containing a heart but limited blood vessels. The most primitive, diploblastic animal
phyla lack circulatory systems.
An additional transport system, the lymphatic system, which is only found in animals with a closed blood
circulation, is an open system providing an accessory route for excess interstitial fluid to be returned to the
blood.[5]

The open circulatory system of the

hemolymph is pumped through the
heart, into the aorta, dispersed into
the head and throughout the
hemocoel, then back through the
ostia in the heart and the process
repeated.
Flatworms, such as this
Pseudoceros bifurcus, lack
specialized circulatory organs.

The blood vascular system first appeared probably in an ancestor of
the triploblasts over 600 million years ago, overcoming the time-
distance constraints of diffusion, while endothelium evolved in an
ancestral vertebrate some 540–510 million years ago.[26]
In arthropods, the open circulatory system is a system in which a
fluid in a cavity called the hemocoel bathes the organs directly with
oxygen and nutrients, with there being no distinction between blood
and interstitial fluid; this combined fluid is called hemolymph or
haemolymph.[27] Muscular movements by the animal during
locomotion can facilitate hemolymph movement, but diverting flow
from one area to another is limited. When the heart relaxes, blood is
drawn back toward the heart through open-ended pores (ostia).
Hemolymph fills all of the interior hemocoel of the body and
surrounds all cells. Hemolymph is composed of water, inorganic
salts (mostly sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium, and calcium), and organic compounds (mostly
carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids). The primary oxygen transporter molecule is hemocyanin.
There are free-floating cells, the hemocytes, within the hemolymph. They play a role in the arthropod
immune system.
The circulatory systems of all vertebrates, as well as of annelids (for
example, earthworms) and cephalopods (squids, octopuses and
relatives) always keep their circulating blood enclosed within heart
chambers or blood vessels and are classified as closed, just as in
humans. Still, the systems of fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds
show various stages of the evolution of the circulatory system.[28]
Closed systems permit blood to be directed to the organs that
require it.
In fish, the system has only one circuit, with the blood being
pumped through the capillaries of the gills and on to the capillaries
of the body tissues. This is known as single cycle circulation. The
heart of fish is, therefore, only a single pump (consisting of two
chambers).
In amphibians and most reptiles, a double circulatory system is
used, but the heart is not always completely separated into two
pumps. Amphibians have a three-chambered heart.
In reptiles, the ventricular septum of the heart is incomplete and the pulmonary artery is equipped with a
sphincter muscle. This allows a second possible route of blood flow. Instead of blood flowing through the
pulmonary artery to the lungs, the sphincter may be contracted to divert this blood flow through the

incomplete ventricular septum into the left ventricle and out through the aorta. This means the blood flows
from the capillaries to the heart and back to the capillaries instead of to the lungs. This process is useful to
ectothermic (cold-blooded) animals in the regulation of their body temperature.
Mammals, birds and crocodilians show complete separation of the heart into two pumps, for a total of four
heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of birds and crocodilians evolved independently
from that of mammals.[29] Double circulatory systems permit blood to be repressurized after returning from
the lungs, speeding up delivery of oxygen to tissues.
Circulatory systems are absent in some animals, including flatworms. Their body cavity has no lining or
enclosed fluid. Instead, a muscular pharynx leads to an extensively branched digestive system that facilitates
direct diffusion of nutrients to all cells. The flatworm's dorso-ventrally flattened body shape also restricts the
distance of any cell from the digestive system or the exterior of the organism. Oxygen can diffuse from the
surrounding water into the cells, and carbon dioxide can diffuse out. Consequently, every cell is able to
obtain nutrients, water and oxygen without the need of a transport system.
Some animals, such as jellyfish, have more extensive branching from their gastrovascular cavity (which
functions as both a place of digestion and a form of circulation), this branching allows for bodily fluids to
reach the outer layers, since the digestion begins in the inner layers.
The earliest known writings on the circulatory system are found in the Ebers Papyrus (16th century BCE),
an ancient Egyptian medical papyrus containing over 700 prescriptions and remedies, both physical and
spiritual. In the papyrus, it acknowledges the connection of the heart to the arteries. The Egyptians thought
air came in through the mouth and into the lungs and heart. From the heart, the air travelled to every
member through the arteries. Although this concept of the circulatory system is only partially correct, it
represents one of the earliest accounts of scientific thought.
In the 6th century BCE, the knowledge of circulation of vital fluids through the body was known to the
Ayurvedic physician Sushruta in ancient India.[30] He also seems to have possessed knowledge of the
arteries, described as 'channels' by Dwivedi & Dwivedi (2007).[30] The valves of the heart were discovered
by a physician of the Hippocratean school around the 4th century BCE. However, their function was not
properly understood then. Because blood pools in the veins after death, arteries look empty. Ancient
anatomists assumed they were filled with air and that they were for the transport of air.
The Greek physician, Herophilus, distinguished veins from arteries but thought that the pulse was a
property of arteries themselves. Greek anatomist Erasistratus observed that arteries that were cut during life
bleed. He ascribed the fact to the phenomenon that air escaping from an artery is replaced with blood that
enters between veins and arteries by very small vessels. Thus he apparently postulated capillaries but with
reversed flow of blood.
In 2nd-century AD Rome, the Greek physician Galen knew that blood vessels carried blood and identified
venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions.
Growth and energy were derived from venous blood created in the liver from chyle, while arterial blood
gave vitality by containing pneuma (air) and originated in the heart. Blood flowed from both creating

organs to all parts of the body where it was consumed and there
was no return of blood to the heart or liver. The heart did not pump
blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during diastole
and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves.
Galen believed that the arterial blood was created by venous blood
passing from the left ventricle to the right by passing through 'pores'
in the interventricular septum, air passed from the lungs via the
pulmonary artery to the left side of the heart. As the arterial blood
was created 'sooty' vapors were created and passed to the lungs also
via the pulmonary artery to be exhaled.
In 1025, The Canon of Medicine by the Persian physician,
Avicenna, "erroneously accepted the Greek notion regarding the
existence of a hole in the ventricular septum by which the blood
traveled between the ventricles." Despite this, Avicenna "correctly
wrote on the cardiac cycles and valvular function", and "had a
vision of blood circulation" in his Treatise on Pulse.[31] While also
refining Galen's erroneous theory of the pulse, Avicenna provided
the first correct explanation of pulsation: "Every beat of the pulse
comprises two movements and two pauses. Thus, expansion  :
pause  : contraction  : pause. [...] The pulse is a movement in the
heart and arteries ... which takes the form of alternate expansion and
contraction."[32]
In 1242, the Arabian physician, Ibn al-Nafis described the process
of pulmonary circulation in greater, more accurate detail than his
predecessors, though he believed, as they did, in the notion of vital
spirit (pneuma), which he believed was formed in the left ventricle.
Ibn al-Nafis stated in his Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's
Canon:
...the blood from the right chamber of the heart must arrive at the left chamber but there is no
direct pathway between them. The thick septum of the heart is not perforated and does not
have visible pores as some people thought or invisible pores as Galen thought. The blood from
the right chamber must flow through the vena arteriosa (pulmonary artery) to the lungs, spread
through its substances, be mingled there with air, pass through the arteria venosa (pulmonary
vein) to reach the left chamber of the heart and there form the vital spirit...
In addition, Ibn al-Nafis had an insight into what would become a larger theory of the capillary circulation.
He stated that "there must be small communications or pores (manafidh in Arabic) between the pulmonary
artery and vein," a prediction that preceded the discovery of the capillary system by more than 400
years.[33] Ibn al-Nafis' theory, however, was confined to blood transit in the lungs and did not extend to the
entire body.
Image of veins from William Harvey's
Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu
Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus,
1628
Michael Servetus was the first European to describe the function of pulmonary circulation, although his
achievement was not widely recognized at the time, for a few reasons. He firstly described it in the
"Manuscript of Paris"[34][35] (near 1546), but this work was never published. And later he published this
description, but in a theological treatise, Christianismi Restitutio, not in a book on medicine. Only three
copies of the book survived but these remained hidden for decades, the rest were burned shortly after its
publication in 1553 because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities.
A better known discovery of pulmonary circulation was by Vesalius's successor at Padua, Realdo Colombo,
in 1559.
Finally, the English physician William Harvey, a pupil of
Hieronymus Fabricius (who had earlier described the valves of the
veins without recognizing their function), performed a sequence of
experiments and published his Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu
Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus in 1628, which "demonstrated
that there had to be a direct connection between the venous and
arterial systems throughout the body, and not just the lungs. Most
importantly, he argued that the beat of the heart produced a
continuous circulation of blood through minute connections at the
extremities of the body. This is a conceptual leap that was quite
different from Ibn al-Nafis' refinement of the anatomy and
bloodflow in the heart and lungs."[36] This work, with its
essentially correct exposition, slowly convinced the medical world.
However, Harvey was not able to identify the capillary system connecting arteries and veins; these were
later discovered by Marcello Malpighi in 1661.
