Artery
An artery (from Greek ἀρτηρία (artēríā))[1] is a blood vessel
in humans and most other animals that takes oxygenated blood
away from the heart in the systemic circulation to one or more
parts of the body. Exceptions that carry deoxygenated blood are
the pulmonary arteries in the pulmonary circulation that carry
blood to the lungs for oxygenation, and the umbilical arteries in
the fetal circulation that carry deoxygenated blood to the
placenta. It consists of a multi-layered artery wall wrapped into
a tube-shaped channel.
Arteries contrast with veins, which carry deoxygenated blood
back towards the heart; or in the pulmonary and fetal
circulations carry oxygenated blood to the lungs and fetus
respectively.
The anatomy of arteries can be separated into gross anatomy, at
the macroscopic level, and microanatomy, which must be
studied with a microscope. The arterial system of the human
body is divided into systemic arteries, carrying blood from the
heart to the whole body, and pulmonary arteries, carrying
deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs.
As with veins, the arterial wall consists of three layers called
tunics, namely the tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica
externa, from innermost to outermost. The externa, alternatively
known as the tunica adventitia, is composed of collagen fibers
and elastic tissue—with the largest arteries containing vasa
vasorum, small blood vessels that supply the walls of large
blood vessels.[2] Most of the layers have a clear boundary
between them, however the tunica externa has a boundary that
is ill-defined. Normally its boundary is considered when it
meets or touches the connective tissue.[3] Inside this layer is the
tunica media, which is made up of smooth muscle cells, elastic
tissue (also called connective tissue proper) and collagen
fibres.[2] The innermost layer, which is in direct contact with
the flow of blood, is the tunica intima. The elastic tissue allows
the artery to bend and fit through places in the body. This layer

Cross-section of a human artery
Arteries form part of the human
circulatory system
is mainly made up of endothelial cells (and a supporting layer
of elastin rich collagen in elastic arteries). The hollow internal
cavity in which the blood flows is called the lumen.
Arterial formation begins and ends when endothelial cells begin to
express arterial specific genes, such as ephrin B2.[4]
Arteries form part of the circulatory system. They carry blood that is
oxygenated after it has been pumped from the heart. Coronary
arteries also aid the heart in pumping blood by sending oxygenated
blood to the heart, allowing the muscles to function. Arteries carry
oxygenated blood away from the heart to the tissues, except for
pulmonary arteries, which carry blood to the lungs for oxygenation
(usually veins carry deoxygenated blood to the heart but the
pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood as well).[5] There are two
types of unique arteries. The pulmonary artery carries blood from
the heart to the lungs, where it receives oxygen. It is unique because
the blood in it is not "oxygenated", as it has not yet passed through
the lungs. The other unique artery is the umbilical artery, which
carries deoxygenated blood from a fetus to its mother.
Arteries have a blood pressure higher than other parts of the
circulatory system. The pressure in arteries varies during the cardiac
cycle. It is highest when the heart contracts and lowest when heart
relaxes. The variation in pressure produces a pulse, which can be
felt in different areas of the body, such as the radial pulse. Arterioles
have the greatest collective influence on both local blood flow and
on overall blood pressure. They are the primary "adjustable
nozzles" in the blood system, across which the greatest pressure
drop occurs. The combination of heart output (cardiac output) and
systemic vascular resistance, which refers to the collective
resistance of all of the body's arterioles, are the principal
determinants of arterial blood pressure at any given moment.
Arteries have the highest pressure and have narrow lumen diameter.
Systemic arteries are the arteries (including the peripheral arteries),
of the systemic circulation, which is the part of the cardiovascular
system that carries oxygenated blood away from the heart, to the
body, and returns deoxygenated blood back to the heart. Systemic
arteries can be subdivided into two types—muscular and elastic—
according to the relative compositions of elastic and muscle tissue in
their tunica media as well as their size and the makeup of the
Development
Function
The aorta is the largest blood vessel
in human body
internal and external elastic lamina. The larger arteries (>10  mm diameter) are generally elastic and the
smaller ones (0.1–10 mm) tend to be muscular. Systemic arteries deliver blood to the arterioles, and then to
the capillaries, where nutrients and gasses are exchanged.
After traveling from the aorta, blood travels through peripheral arteries into smaller arteries called arterioles,
and eventually to capillaries. Arterioles help in regulating blood pressure by the variable contraction of the
smooth muscle of their walls, and deliver blood to the capillaries. This smooth muscle contraction is
primarily influenced by activity of the sympathetic vasomotor nerves innervating the arterioles.[6] [7]
Enhanced sympathetic activation prompts vasoconstriction, reducing the lumen diameter. A reduced lumen
diameter consequently elevates the blood pressure within the arterioles.[8] Conversely, decreased
sympathetic activity within the vasomotor nerves causes vasodilation of the vessels thereby decreasing
blood pressure.[9]
The aorta is the root systemic artery (i.e., main artery). In humans, it
receives blood directly from the left ventricle of the heart via the
aortic valve. As the aorta branches and these arteries branch, in turn,
they become successively smaller in diameter, down to the
arterioles. The arterioles supply capillaries, which in turn empty into
venules. The first branches off of the aorta are the coronary arteries,
which supply blood to the heart muscle itself. These are followed
by the branches of the aortic arch, namely the brachiocephalic
artery, the left common carotid, and the left subclavian arteries.
The capillaries are the smallest of the blood vessels and are part of
the microcirculation. The microvessels have a width of a single cell
in diameter to aid in the fast and easy diffusion of gasses, sugars
and nutrients to surrounding tissues. Capillaries have no smooth muscle surrounding them and have a
diameter less than that of red blood cells; a red blood cell is typically 7 micrometers outside diameter,
capillaries typically 5 micrometers inside diameter. The red blood cells must distort in order to pass through
the capillaries.
These small diameters of the capillaries provide a relatively large surface area for the exchange of gasses
and nutrients.
Systemic arterial pressures are generated by the forceful contractions of the heart's left ventricle. High blood
pressure is a factor in causing arterial damage. Healthy resting arterial pressures are relatively low, mean
systemic pressures typically being under 100  mmHg (1.9  psi; 13  kPa) above surrounding atmospheric
pressure (about 760 mmHg, 14.7 psi, 101 kPa at sea level). To withstand and adapt to the pressures within,
arteries are surrounded by varying thicknesses of smooth muscle which have extensive elastic and inelastic

connective tissues. The pulse pressure, being the difference
between systolic and diastolic pressure, is determined primarily by
the amount of blood ejected by each heart beat, stroke volume,
versus the volume and elasticity of the major arteries.
A blood squirt, also known as an arterial gush, is the effect when an
artery is cut due to the higher arterial pressures. Blood is spurted out
at a rapid, intermittent rate, that coincides with the heartbeat. The
amount of blood loss can be copious, can occur very rapidly, and be
life-threatening.[10]
Over time, factors such as elevated arterial blood sugar (particularly
as seen in diabetes mellitus), lipoprotein, cholesterol, high blood
pressure, stress and smoking, are all implicated in damaging both
the endothelium and walls of the arteries, resulting in
atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a disease marked by the hardening of arteries. This is caused by an
atheroma or plaque in the artery wall and is a build-up of cell debris, that contain lipids, (cholesterol and
fatty acids), calcium[11][12] and a variable amount of fibrous connective tissue.
Accidental intra-arterial injection either iatrogenically or through recreational drug use can cause symptoms
such as intense pain, paresthesia and necrosis. It usually causes permanent damage to the limb; often
amputation is necessary.[13]
Among the Ancient Greeks before Hippocrates, all blood vessels were called Φλέβες, phlebes. The word
arteria then referred to the windpipe.[14] Herophilos was the first to describe anatomical differences
between the two types of blood vessel. While Empedocles believed that the blood moved to and fro through
the blood vessels, there was no concept of the capillary vessels that join arteries and veins, and there was no
notion of circulation.[15] Diogenes of Apollonia developed the theory of pneuma, originally meaning just
air but soon identified with the soul itself, and thought to co-exist with the blood in the blood vessels.[16]
The arteries were thought to be responsible for the transport of air to the tissues and to be connected to the
trachea. This was as a result of finding the arteries of cadavers devoid of blood.
In medieval times, it was supposed that arteries carried a fluid, called "spiritual blood" or "vital spirits",
considered to be different from the contents of the veins. This theory went back to Galen. In the late
medieval period, the trachea,[17] and ligaments were also called "arteries".[18]
William Harvey described and popularized the modern concept of the circulatory system and the roles of
arteries and veins in the 17th century.
Alexis Carrel at the beginning of the 20th century first described the technique for vascular suturing and
anastomosis and successfully performed many organ transplantations in animals; he thus actually opened
the way to modern vascular surgery that was previously limited to vessels' permanent ligation.

"Unintentional intra-arterial injection of medication, either iatrogenic or self-administered, is a
source of considerable morbidity. Normal vascular anatomical proximity, aberrant
vasculature, procedurally difficult situations, and medical personnel error all contribute to
unintentional cannulation of arteries in an attempt to achieve intravenous access. Delivery of
certain medications via arterial access has led to clinically important sequelae, including
paresthesias, severe pain, motor dysfunction, compartment syndrome, gangrene, and limb
loss. We comprehensively review the current literature, highlighting available information on
risk factors, symptoms, pathogenesis, sequelae, and management strategies for
unintentional intra-arterial injection. We believe that all physicians and ancillary personnel
who administer intravenous therapies should be aware of this serious problem."
