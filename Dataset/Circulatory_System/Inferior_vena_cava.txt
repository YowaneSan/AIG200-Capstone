Inferior vena cava
The inferior vena cava is a large vein
that carries the deoxygenated blood
from the lower and middle body into
the right atrium of the heart. It is formed
by the joining of the right and the left
common iliac veins, usually at the level
of the fifth lumbar vertebra.[1][2]
The inferior vena cava is the lower
("inferior") of the two venae cavae, the
two large veins that carry deoxygenated
blood from the body to the right atrium
of the heart: the inferior vena cava
carries blood from the lower half of the
body whilst the superior vena cava
carries blood from the upper half of the
body. Together, the venae cavae (in
addition to the coronary sinus, which
carries blood from the muscle of the
heart 
itself) 
form 
the 
venous
counterparts of the aorta.
It is a large retroperitoneal vein that lies
posterior to the abdominal cavity and
runs along the right side of the vertebral
column.[1] It enters the right auricle at
the lower right, back side of the heart.
The name derives from Latin: vena,
"vein", cavus, "hollow".
The IVC is formed by the joining of the
left and right common iliac veins and
brings collected blood into the right
atrium of the heart.[1] It also joins with
the azygos vein (which runs on the
right side of the vertebral column) and
venous plexuses next to the spinal cord.

The inferior vena cava begins as the left
and right common iliac veins behind the
abdomen unite, at about the level of
L5.[1][2] It passes through the thoracic
diaphragm at the caval opening at the
level of T8 - T9.[1][3] It passes to the
right of the descending aorta.[3]
The specific levels of the tributaries are
as follows:
Level
Vein
T8
hepatic veins, inferior phrenic
vein
L1
right suprarenal vein, renal
veins
L2
right gonadal vein
L1–
L5
lumbar veins
L5
common iliac veins
Because the inferior vena cava is
located to the right of the midline,
drainage of the tributaries is not always
symmetrical. On the right, the gonadal
veins and suprarenal veins drain into
the inferior vena cava directly.[1] On the
left, they drain into the renal vein which
in turn drains into the inferior vena
cava.[1] By contrast, all the lumbar
veins and hepatic veins usually drain
directly into the inferior vena cava.[1]
In the embryo, the inferior vena cava
and right auricle are separated by the
valve of the inferior vena cava, also
known as the Eustachian valve. In the
adult, this valve typically has totally
regressed or remains as a small fold of
endocardium.[4]

Anatomical terminology
Rarely, the inferior vena cava may vary
in its size and position. In transposition
of the great arteries the inferior vena
cava may lie on the left.
In between 0.2% to 0.3% of people,[5]
the 
inferior 
vena 
cava 
may 
be
duplicated beneath the level of the renal
veins.[6]
The inferior vena cava is a vein. It carries deoxygenated blood from the lower half of the body to the right
atrium of the heart.[6]
The corresponding vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the upper half of the body is the superior
vena cava.
Health problems attributed to the IVC are most often associated with it being compressed (ruptures are rare
because it has a low intraluminal pressure). Typical sources of external pressure are an enlarged aorta
(abdominal aortic aneurysm), the gravid uterus (aortocaval compression syndrome) and abdominal
malignancies, such as colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer. Since the inferior vena
cava is primarily a right-sided structure, unconscious pregnant women should be turned on to their left side
(the recovery position), to relieve pressure on it and facilitate venous return. In rare cases, straining
associated with defecation can lead to restricted blood flow through the IVC and result in syncope
(fainting).[7]
Blockage of the inferior vena cava is rare and is treated urgently as a life-threatening condition. It is
associated with deep vein thrombosis, IVC filters, liver transplantation and surgical procedures such as the
insertion of a catheter in the femoral vein in the groin.[8]
