Pulmonary circulation
The pulmonary circulation is a division of the circulatory
system in all vertebrates. The circuit begins with deoxygenated
blood returned from the body to the right atrium of the heart
where it is pumped out from the right ventricle to the lungs. In
the lungs the blood is oxygenated and returned to the left atrium
to complete the circuit.[1]
The other division of the circulatory system is the systemic
circulation that begins with receiving the oxygenated blood
from the pulmonary circulation into the left atrium. From the
atrium the oxygenated blood enters the left ventricle where it is
pumped out to the rest of the body, returning as deoxygenated
blood back to the pulmonary circulation.
The blood vessels of the pulmonary circulation are the
pulmonary arteries and the pulmonary veins.
A separate circulatory circuit known as the bronchial circulation
supplies oxygenated blood to the tissue of the larger airways of
the lung.
De-oxygenated blood leaves the heart,
goes to the lungs, and then enters back
into the heart.[2] De-oxygenated blood
leaves through the right ventricle
through the pulmonary artery.[2] From
the right atrium, the blood is pumped
through the tricuspid valve (or right
atrioventricular valve) into the right
ventricle. Blood is then pumped from
the 
right 
ventricle 
through 
the
pulmonary 
valve 
and 
into 
the
pulmonary artery.[2]

respiration.[3] Arteries are further divided into very fine capillaries
which are extremely thin-walled.[4] The pulmonary veins return
oxygenated blood to the left atrium of the heart.[3]
Oxygenated blood leaves the lungs through pulmonary veins,
which return it to the left part of the heart, completing the
pulmonary cycle.[3][5] This blood then enters the left atrium, which
pumps it through the mitral valve into the left ventricle.[3][5] From
the left ventricle, the blood passes through the aortic valve to the
aorta.[3][5] The blood is then distributed to the body through the
systemic circulation before returning again to the pulmonary
circulation.[3][5]
From the right ventricle, blood is pumped through the semilunar pulmonary valve into the left and right
main pulmonary artery (one for each lung), which branch into smaller pulmonary arteries that spread
throughout the lungs.[3][5]
The pulmonary circulation loop is virtually bypassed in fetal circulation.[6] The fetal lungs are collapsed,
and blood passes from the right atrium directly into the left atrium through the foramen ovale (an open
conduit between the paired atria) or through the ductus arteriosus (a shunt between the pulmonary artery
and the aorta).[6]
When the lungs expand at birth, the pulmonary pressure drops and blood is drawn from the right atrium into
the right ventricle and through the pulmonary circuit. Over the course of several months, the foramen ovale
closes, leaving a shallow depression known as the fossa ovalis.[6][7]
A number of medical conditions may affect the pulmonary circulation:
Pulmonary hypertension describes an increase in resistance in the pulmonary arteries.[8]
Pulmonary embolism is occlusion or partial occlusion of the pulmonary artery or its branches
by an embolus, usually from the embolization of a blood clot from deep vein thrombosis.[9] It
can cause difficulty breathing or chest pain, is usually diagnosed through a CT pulmonary
angiography or V/Q scan, and is often treated with anticoagulants such as heparin and
warfarin.[10]
Cardiac shunt is an unnatural connection between parts of the heart that leads to blood flow
that bypasses the lungs.[11]

Pulmonary shunt
The pulmonary circulation is archaically known as the "lesser
circulation" which is still used in non-English literature.[13][14]
The discovery of the pulmonary circulation has been attributed to
many scientists with credit distributed in varying ratios by varying
sources. In much of modern medical literature, the discovery is
credited to English physician William Harvey (1578 – 1657 CE)
based on the comprehensive completeness and correctness of his
model, despite its relative recency.[15][16] Other sources credit
Greek philosopher Hippocrates (460 – 370 BCE), Spanish
physician Michael Servetus (c. 1509 – 1553 CE), Arab physician
Ibn al-Nafis (1213 – 1288 CE), and Syrian physician Qusta ibn
Luqa.[17][18][19][20] Several figures such as Hippocrates and al-
Nafis receive credit for accurately predicting or developing specific
elements of the modern model of pulmonary circulation:
Hippocrates[19] for being the first to describe pulmonary circulation
as a discrete system separable from systemic circulation as a whole
and al-Nafis[21] for making great strides over the understanding of
those before him and towards a rigorous model. There is a great
deal of subjectivity involved in deciding at which point a complex
system is "discovered", as it is typically elucidated in piecemeal
form so that the very first description, most complete or accurate description, and the most significant
forward leaps in understanding are all considered acts of discovery of varying significance.[19]
Primitive descriptions of the cardiovascular system are found throughout several ancient cultures. The
earliest known description of the role of air in circulation was produced in Egypt in 3500 BCE. At the time,
the Egyptians believed that the heart was the origin of many channels that connected different parts of the
body to each other and transported air – as well as urine, blood, and the soul – between them.[22] The
Edwin Smith Papyrus (1700 BCE), named for American Egyptologist Edwin Smith (1822 – 1906 CE) who
purchased the scroll in 1862, provided evidence that Egyptians believed that the heartbeat created a pulse
that transported the above substances throughout the body.[23] A second scroll, the Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550
BCE), also emphasized the importance of the heart and its connection to vessels throughout the body and
described methods to detect cardiac disease through pulse abnormalities. Although they had knowledge of
the heartbeat, vessels, and pulse, the Egyptians attributed the movement of substances through the vessels to
air that resided in these channels, rather than to the heart's exertion of pressure.[24] The Egyptians knew that
air played an important role in circulation but did not yet have a conception of the role of the lungs.
The next addition to the historical understanding of pulmonary circulation arrived with the Ancient Greeks.
Physician Alcmaeon (520 – 450 BCE) proposed that the brain, not the heart, was the connection point for
all of the vessels in the body. He believed that the function of these vessels was to bring the "spirit"
("pneuma") and air to the brain.[22][25] Empedocles (492 – 432 BCE), a philosopher, proposed a series of
pipes, impermeable to blood but continuous with blood vessels, that carried the pneuma throughout the
body. He proposed that this spirit was internalized by pulmonary respiration.[22]
History
Hippocrates was the first to describe pulmonary circulation as a discrete system, separable from systemic
circulation, in his Corpus Hippocraticum, which is often regarded as the foundational text of modern
medicine.[19] Hippocrates developed the view that the liver and spleen produced blood, and that this
traveled to the heart to be cooled by the lungs that surrounded it.[18] He described the heart as having two
ventricles connected by an interventricular septum, and depicted the heart as the nexus point of all of the
vessels of the body. He proposed that some vessels carried only blood and that others carried only air. He
hypothesized that these air-carrying vessels were divisible into the pulmonary veins, which carried in air to
the left ventricle, and the pulmonary artery, which carried in air to the right ventricle and blood to the lungs.
He also proposed the existence of two atria of the heart functioning to capture air. He was one of the first to
begin to accurately describe the anatomy of the heart and to describe the involvement of the lungs in
circulation. His descriptions built substantially on previous and contemporaneous efforts but, by modern
standards, his conceptions of pulmonary circulation and of the functions of the parts of the heart were still
largely inaccurate.[22]
Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) followed Hippocrates and proposed that the
heart had three ventricles, rather than two, that all connected to the lungs.[22] Greek physician Erasistratus
(315 – 240 BCE) agreed with Hippocrates and Aristotle that the heart was the origin of all of the vessels in
the body but proposed a system in which air was drawn into the lungs and traveled to the left ventricle via
pulmonary veins. It was transformed there into the pneuma and distributed throughout the body by arteries,
which contained only air.[23] In this system, veins distributed blood throughout the body, and thus blood did
not circulate, but rather was consumed by the organs.[22]
The Greek physician Galen (129 – c. 210 CE) provided the next insights into pulmonary circulation.
Though many of his theories, like those of his predecessors, were marginally or completely incorrect, his
theory of pulmonary circulation dominated the medical community's understanding for hundreds of years
after his death.[23] Galen contradicted Erasistratus before him by proposing that arteries carried both air and
blood, rather than air alone (which was essentially correct, leaving aside that blood vessels carry
constituents of air and not air itself).[18] He proposed that the liver was the originating point of all blood
vessels. He also theorized that the heart was not a pumping muscle but rather an organ through which blood
passed.[23] Galen's theory included a new description of pulmonary circulation: air was inhaled into the
lungs where it became the pneuma. Pulmonary veins transmitted this pneuma to the left ventricle of the
heart to cool the blood simultaneously arriving there. This mixture of pneuma, blood, and cooling produced
the vital spirits that could then be transported throughout the body via arteries. Galen further proposed that
the heat of the blood arriving in the heart produced noxious vapors that were expelled through the same
pulmonary veins that first brought the pneuma.[26] He wrote that the right ventricle played a different role to
the left: it transported blood to the lungs where the impurities were vented out so that clean blood could be
distributed throughout the body. Though Galen's description of the anatomy of the heart was more complete
than those of his predecessors, it included several mistakes. Most notably, Galen believed that blood flowed
between the two ventricles of the heart through small, invisible pores in the interventricular septum.[22]
The next significant developments in the understanding of pulmonary circulation did not arrive until
centuries later. Persian polymath Avicenna (c. 980 – 1037 CE) wrote a medical encyclopedia entitled The
Canon of Medicine. In it, he translated and compiled contemporary medical knowledge and added some
new information of his own.[21] However, Avicenna's description of pulmonary circulation reflected the
incorrect views of Galen.[18]
The Arab physician, Ibn al-Nafis, wrote the Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon in 1242 in
which he provided possibly the first known description of the system that remains substantially congruent
with modern understandings, in spite of its flaws. Ibn al-Nafis made two key improvements on Galen's
ideas. First, he disproved the existence of the pores in the interventricular septum that Galen had believed
allowed blood to flow between the left and right ventricles. Second, he surmised that the only way for
blood to get from the right to the left ventricle in the absence of interventricular pores was a system like
pulmonary circulation. He also described the anatomy of the lungs in clear and basically correct detail,
which his predecessors had not.[21] However, like Aristotle and Galen, al-Nafis still believed in the quasi-
mythical concept of vital spirit and that it was formed in the left ventricle from a mixture of blood and air.
Despite the enormity of Ibn al-Nafis's improvements on the theories that preceded him, his commentary on
The Canon was not widely known to Western scholars until the manuscript was discovered in Berlin,
Germany, in 1924. As a result, the ongoing debate among Western scholars as to how credit for the
discovery should be apportioned failed to include Ibn al-Nafis until, at earliest, the mid-20th century (shortly
after which he came to enjoy a share of this credit).[18][21] In 2021, several researchers described a text
predating the work of al-Nafis, fargh- beyn-roh va nafs, in which there is a comparable report on pulmonary
circulation. The researchers argue that its author, Qusta ibn Luqa, is the best candidate for the discoverer of
pulmonary circulation on a similar basis to arguments in favour of al-Nafis generally.[20]
It took centuries for other scientists and physicians to reach conclusions that were similar to and then more
accurate than those of al-Nafis and ibn Luqa. This later progress, constituting the gap between medieval and
modern understanding, occurred throughout Europe. Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci (1452 – 1519 CE)
was one of the first to propose that the heart was just a muscle, rather than a vessel of spirits and air, but he
still subscribed to Galen's ideas of circulation and defended the existence of interventricular pores.[22] The
Flemish physician Andreas Vesalius (1514 – 1564 CE) published corrections to Galen's view of circulatory
anatomy, questioning the existence of interventricular pores, in his book De humani corporis fabrica libri
septem in 1543.[26] Spanish Michael Servetus, after him, was the first European physician to accurately
describe pulmonary circulation.[17] His assertions largely matched those of al-Nafis. In subsequent
centuries, he has frequently been credited with the discovery, but some historians have propounded the idea
that he potentially had access to Ibn al-Nafis's work while writing his own texts.[18] Servetus published his
findings in Christianismi Restituto (1553): a theological work that was considered heretical by Catholics
and Calvinists alike. As a result, both book and author were burned at the stake and only a few copies of his
work survived.[18] Italian physician Realdo Colombo (c. 1515 – 1559 CE) published a book, De re
anatomica libri XV, in 1559 that accurately described pulmonary circulation. It is still a matter of debate
among historians as to whether Colombo reached his conclusions alone or based them to an unknown
degree on the works of al-Nafis and Servetus.[18][22] Finally, in 1628, the influential British physician
William Harvey (1578 – 1657 AD) provided at the time the most complete and accurate description of
pulmonary circulation of any scholar worldwide in his treatise Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et
Sanguinis in Animalibus. At the macroscopic level, his model is still recognizable in and reconcilable with
modern understandings of pulmonary circulation.[15]
