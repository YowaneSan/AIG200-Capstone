Skeletonization
Skeletonization is the state of a dead organism after undergoing
decomposition.[1] Skeletonization refers to the final stage of
decomposition, during which the last vestiges of the soft tissues of a
corpse or carcass have decayed or dried to the point that the
skeleton is exposed. By the end of the skeletonization process, all
soft tissue will have been eliminated, leaving only disarticulated
bones.[2]
In a temperate climate, it usually requires three weeks to several
years for a body to
completely decompose
into 
a 
skeleton,
depending on factors
such as temperature,
humidity, presence of
insects, 
and
submergence 
in 
a
substrate

water.[3] 
In 
tropical
climates,
skeletonization can occur in weeks, while in tundra areas, skeletonization may take years or may never
occur, if freezing temperatures persist. Natural embalming processes in peat bogs or salt deserts can delay
the process indefinitely, sometimes resulting in natural mummification.[4]
The rate of skeletonization and the present condition of a corpse or carcass can be used to determine the
time of death.[5]
After skeletonization, if scavenging animals do not destroy or remove the bones, acids in many fertile soils
take about 20 years to completely dissolve the skeleton of mid- to large-size mammals, such as humans,
leaving no trace of the organism. In neutral-pH soil or sand, the skeleton can persist for hundreds of years
before it finally disintegrates. Alternately, especially in very fine, dry, salty, anoxic, or mildly alkaline soils,
bones may undergo fossilization, converting into minerals that may persist indefinitely.[4]
Before analysing skeletal remains, it is essential to categorise the skeletal remains for its respective discipline
for further investigation. In other words, researchers have to determine the skeletal remains’ significance.
There are key procedures to follow in order to categorise the skeletal remains. First, extraneous materials
that are not bones or teeth should be extinguished.[6] Subsequently, researchers need to identify human
bones from skeletal remains. Human bones will be examined for their significance deemed for forensic

investigation purposes only.[6] Otherwise, human bones will be proceeded to the next examination on the
alternative possible significance that the skeletal remains have. Other than forensic contexts, skeletal
remains can be classified as education or archaeological material education or anatomical material, war
memorial items or archaeological materials which could be cemetery remains traced back from prehistorical
or historical times.[6]
Once a pool of skeletal remains is collected, bones and non bone
materials will be mixed together. In order to avoid non bone
materials being misinterpreted as bones, the following methods are
applied to increase the efficiency of distinguishing bones and non
bone materials.[7] A microscope can be used to examine whether
there is an absence of graininess that will only appear on a bone's
surface.[7] Scanning electron microscopy and energy- dispersive X-
ray spectroscopy are used to examine the chemical composition of
any materials that are suspected to be bones. The results of the
chemical composition test will be compared with the bone
specimens of a FBI's database named Spectral Library for Identification. Non bone materials are obvious to
be detected since non bone materials do not have the same ratio of calcium-to-phosphorus that bones
have.[7]
When the suspected material is identified as bone, the next procedure is to categorise which bones belong to
humans or animals. This procedure is conducted by forensic anthropologists since their daily tasks are to
identify human bones.[7] There are skeletal variations in both human and nonhuman bones.[7] In terms of
human bones, forensic anthropologists need to categorise human bones in accordance to their respective
biological ages through investigating the maturity of the human bones.[7] If the size of a piece of bone is
suspected of having the same size of young adult bones, researchers will proceed to consider the possible
factor of maturity and the presence of fused epiphyses for further analysis of classifying a bone as a young
adult bone or a non bone.[7] Small fragments of human bones or large mammalian animal bones will be
easily confused occasionally.[7]
Hence, microscopic methods are used to determine the external features of the bone's surface.[7] Given that
the microscopic pattern of nonhuman bones is plexiform or fibrolamellar if the primary osteon has the linear
arrangement of rows or bands,[7] analysing the microscopic anatomy of large mammalian bone fragments
enables the forensic anthropologists to distinguish large mammals.[7] This does not mean that microscopic
methods can be applied in identifying human bones.[7] Protein radioimmunoassay is a biomolecular method
that identifies human bones and eliminates any nonhuman bones.[7]
Once the skeletal remains are excavated, forensic anthropologists need to ensure the skeletal remains have
fulfilled a contextual criteria upon determining the forensic significance of the skeletal remains.[8] The
clothing that is being left with the skeletons must be contemporary clothing, absence of mortuary artefacts
and buried in a discordant body posture.[8] The timing of the bone quality is also crucial for distinguishing
bones from archaeological bones, the key point to be marked on is the freshness of the bone[8] in which

postmortem intervals will be useful for justifying contemporary skeletal remains from skeletons served for
archaeological purposes.[9] The place of burial, physical characteristics and artefacts next to the skeletal
remains will be taken into consideration to determine its forensic significance.[10]
If the skeletal remains are deemed as materials that have no forensic significance, the skeletal remains will
proceed to an examination of its archaeological significance.[11] This will be determined if the skeletal
remains are situated in a burial setting and the presence of accompanied artefacts beside the skeletons.[11]
The following information listed below is the information that was derived from skeletons.
The pelvis displays sexually dimorphic characteristics,[12] and thus
can be used to infer the sex of the skeleton.[13] Specifically, the hip
bone is dissected into three segments which are the sacroiliac
segment, ischiopubic segment and acetabular segment.[12] Any
changes in the shape of the sciatic notch of the sacroiliac segment
indicate the sex and the sexual maturation of the skeleton.[12]
Females have a larger sciatic notch.[13] The ischiopubic segment
indicates the process of sexual dimorphism during puberty. For
example, the subpubic angle and pubis of females in the ischiopubic
segment is larger.[12]  Sub-pubic concavity is only present in
females.[13] The acetabular segment indicates the spatial
organisation of the general pelvic structure.[12] Through observing
the physical characteristics derived from the hip bones, females have a U-shape subpubic angle and men
have a V-shape subpubic angle.[13] The female pelvis is wider than that of the male in order to enable a safe
pathway for reproduction.[12] The female pelvis is built to enable locomotion and parturition.[12] As males
do not give birth, the male pelvis is narrower.[12] Consequently, males have stronger mastoid processes on
the sides, with nuchal crests and glabellae located in the front and the back respectively.[13]
If the pelvic bone is absent from the skeletal specimen, the size and resiliency of the bones will be examined
to infer sex.[13] The quality of nutrition that the deceased specimen had in its lifetime will affect the size and
resiliency of its bones, so this analysis cannot be considered entirely definitive in assigning sex to a
skeleton.[13]
Trauma means the injury that had occurred on a deceased individual's living tissue which is inflicted by an
external force or mechanism regardless of intentional or incidental means.[14] Analysing trauma provides
insight in detecting and explaining the lesions on the deceased individual or a respective population.[14] By
associating the relationship between trauma and the demographic information derived from the skeleton, the
relationship between them facilitates the process of interpreting the socio- cultural variables that inflicted the
trauma.[14] Trauma analysis is conducted with the cooperation between forensic pathologists and

anthropologists to establish the reason and manner of death.[15] The occurrence of trauma is dissected into
three stages which are ante- mortem, peri- mortem and post- mortem trauma.[15] While peri- and post-
mortem trauma that occurred simultaneously cannot provide hints for forensic pathologists and
anthropologists, post- mortem trauma that occurred after the decomposition stage reveals the distinction
between damage inflicted on dried and de- fleshed bones.[15]
Skeletal age estimation is written in the format of ranges because an individual's chronological age does not
necessarily parallel his or her biological age.[16] Individual health, family genetics and environmental
stressors affect the skeleton age.[16] Hence, the range format is written in the aim of combining the
estimation of the skeleton's chronological age and individual variability.[16] To avoid biased examinations in
skeletal age estimation, at least more than one indicators is required.[17] In order to investigate if there is an
evidence of growth and development on the skeletons, the evolving pattern and fusion of ossification
centers can be used to determine that the skeletons are developed. Thus, this means the skeletons are proven
to be entering the stage of maturation.[18]
Skeletons should be carefully managed and protected in order to retain their original state for further
research purposes in any circumstances, for instance: educational, archaeological, forensic research.[19]
Applying the same case for animal skeletons, there are procedures to follow in the aim of ensuring the
skeletal remains are reserved carefully for research purposes in the future.[20] There are various possible
sizes of collections that researchers might want to reserve for future investigation.[19] For smaller sizes of
bones collections which will be commonly applied to any researchers who retain them for archaeological or
zoological educational purposes, it is suggested to organise those bones into categories, for instance: age
group, tribal or ethnicity group, or sex.[19] The storage method of such small and sophisticated types of
bones is recommended to be placed in a sliding shelf.[19] However, larger collections are served for
academic disciplines that need a broad investigation instead of just focusing on a single piece of bone.[19]
Thus, the preservation and care management method will be different from above. First, researchers have to
note down the basic demographic and mortality information which will be useful for future comparisons
between skeletons.[19] Similarly, for the skeletal remains collected for display or research purposes in the
museum, the physical characteristics and the skeletal remains’ archaeological category has to be
documented in order to acknowledge the background information of the skeletal remains.[21] Next, bones
should be carefully labelled and avoid chemical substances that will affect the original state of the bone that
will affect accuracy of future investigation.[19]
Cultural and social factors affect the objectivity principle required to investigate a corpse.[22] An ethical
dilemma exists when forensic anthropologists and mortuary archaeologists need to adapt to the cultural
context that they are working in respectively while obliged to uphold objectivity when they are engaging in
skeletal analysis.[22] Both forensic anthropologists and mortuary archaeologists should not enable the
working conditions of a particular environment justifying their standard of investigation process.[22]
