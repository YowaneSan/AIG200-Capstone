Anatomical terminology
Human skeleton
The human skeleton is the internal framework of the human body.
It is composed of around 270 bones at birth – this total decreases to
around 206 bones by adulthood after some bones get fused
together.[1] The bone mass in the skeleton makes up about 14% of
the total body weight (ca. 10–11  kg for an average person) and
reaches maximum mass between the ages of 25 and 30.[2] The
human skeleton can be divided into the axial skeleton and the
appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton is formed by the
vertebral column, the rib cage, the skull and other associated bones.
The appendicular skeleton, which is attached to the axial skeleton,
is formed by the shoulder girdle, the pelvic girdle and the bones of
the upper and lower limbs.
The human skeleton performs six major functions: support,
movement, protection, production of blood cells, storage of
minerals, and endocrine regulation.
The human skeleton is not as sexually dimorphic as that of many
other primate species, but subtle differences between sexes in the
morphology of the skull, dentition, long bones, and pelvis exist. In
general, female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust
than corresponding male elements within a given population. The
human female pelvis is also different from that of males in order to
facilitate childbirth.[3] Unlike most primates, human males do not
have penile bones.[4]
The axial skeleton (80 bones) is formed by the vertebral column
(32–34 bones; the number of the vertebrae differs from human to
human as the lower 2 parts, sacral and coccygeal bone may vary in length), a part of the rib cage (12 pairs
of ribs and the sternum), and the skull (22 bones and 7 associated bones).
Divisions
Axial
The upright posture of humans is maintained by the axial skeleton, which transmits the weight from the
head, the trunk, and the upper extremities down to the lower extremities at the hip joints. The bones of the
spine are supported by many ligaments. The erector spinae muscles are also supporting and are useful for
balance.
The appendicular skeleton (126 bones) is formed by the pectoral girdles, the upper limbs, the pelvic girdle
or pelvis, and the lower limbs. Their functions are to make locomotion possible and to protect the major
organs of digestion, excretion and reproduction.
The skeleton serves six major functions: support, movement, protection, production of blood cells, storage
of minerals and endocrine regulation.
The skeleton provides the framework which supports the body and maintains its shape. The pelvis,
associated ligaments and muscles provide a floor for the pelvic structures. Without the rib cages, costal
cartilages, and intercostal muscles, the lungs would collapse.
The joints between bones allow movement, some allowing a wider range of movement than others, e.g. the
ball and socket joint allows a greater range of movement than the pivot joint at the neck. Movement is
powered by skeletal muscles, which are attached to the skeleton at various sites on bones. Muscles, bones,
and joints provide the principal mechanics for movement, all coordinated by the nervous system.
It is believed that the reduction of human bone density in prehistoric times reduced the agility and dexterity
of human movement. Shifting from hunting to agriculture has caused human bone density to reduce
significantly.[5][6][7]
The skeleton helps to protect many vital internal organs from being damaged.
The skull protects the brain
The vertebrae protect the spinal cord.
The rib cage, spine, and sternum protect the lungs, heart and major blood vessels.

During construction of the York to
Scarborough Railway Bridge in 1901,
workmen discovered a large stone
coffin, close to the River Ouse.
Inside was a skeleton, accompanied
by an array of unusual and
expensive objects. This chance find
represents one of the most
significant discoveries ever made
from Roman York. Study of the
skeleton has revealed that it
belonged to a woman.
The skeleton is the site of haematopoiesis, the development of blood cells that takes place in the bone
marrow. In children, haematopoiesis occurs primarily in the marrow of the long bones such as the femur
and tibia. In adults, it occurs mainly in the pelvis, cranium, vertebrae, and sternum.[8]
The bone matrix can store calcium and is involved in calcium metabolism, and bone marrow can store iron
in ferritin and is involved in iron metabolism. However, bones are not entirely made of calcium, but a
mixture of chondroitin sulfate and hydroxyapatite, the latter making up 70% of a bone. Hydroxyapatite is in
turn composed of 39.8% of calcium, 41.4% of oxygen, 18.5% of phosphorus, and 0.2% of hydrogen by
mass. Chondroitin sulfate is a sugar made up primarily of oxygen and carbon.
Bone cells release a hormone called osteocalcin, which contributes to the regulation of blood sugar
(glucose) and fat deposition. Osteocalcin increases both insulin secretion and sensitivity, in addition to
boosting the number of insulin-producing cells and reducing stores of fat.[9]
Anatomical differences between human males and females are
highly pronounced in some soft tissue areas, but tend to be limited
in the skeleton. The human skeleton is not as sexually dimorphic as
that of many other primate species, but subtle differences between
sexes in the morphology of the skull, dentition, long bones, and
pelvis are exhibited across human populations. In general, female
skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than
corresponding male elements within a given population. It is not
known whether or to what extent those differences are genetic or
environmental.
A variety of gross morphological traits of the human skull
demonstrate sexual dimorphism, such as the median nuchal line,
mastoid processes, supraorbital margin, supraorbital ridge, and the
chin.[10]
Human inter-sex dental dimorphism centers on the canine teeth, but it is not nearly as pronounced as in the
other great apes.

Long bones
Long bones are generally larger in males than in females within a given population. Muscle attachment sites
on long bones are often more robust in males than in females, reflecting a difference in overall muscle mass
and development between sexes. Sexual dimorphism in the long bones is commonly characterized by
morphometric or gross morphological analyses.
The human pelvis exhibits greater sexual dimorphism than other bones, specifically in the size and shape of
the pelvic cavity, ilia, greater sciatic notches, and the sub-pubic angle. The Phenice method is commonly
used to determine the sex of an unidentified human skeleton by anthropologists with 96% to 100% accuracy
in some populations.[11]
Women's pelvises are wider in the pelvic inlet and are wider throughout the pelvis to allow for child birth.
The sacrum in the women's pelvis is curved inwards to allow the child to have a "funnel" to assist in the
child's pathway from the uterus to the birth canal.
There are many classified skeletal disorders. One of the most common is osteoporosis. Also common is
scoliosis, a side-to-side curve in the back or spine, often creating a pronounced "C" or "S" shape when
viewed on an x-ray of the spine. This condition is most apparent during adolescence, and is most common
with females.
Arthritis is a disorder of the joints. It involves inflammation of one or more joints. When affected by
arthritis, the joint or joints affected may be painful to move, may move in unusual directions or may be
immobile completely. The symptoms of arthritis will vary differently between types of arthritis. The most
common form of arthritis, osteoarthritis, can affect both the larger and smaller joints of the human skeleton.
The cartilage in the affected joints will degrade, soften and wear away. This decreases the mobility of the
joints and decreases the space between bones where cartilage should be.
Osteoporosis is a disease of bone where there is reduced bone mineral density, increasing the likelihood of
fractures.[12] Osteoporosis is defined by the World Health Organization in women as a bone mineral density
2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass, relative to the age and sex-matched average, as measured by
dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, with the term "established osteoporosis" including the presence of a
fragility fracture.[13] Osteoporosis is most common in women after menopause, when it is called
"postmenopausal osteoporosis", but may develop in men and premenopausal women in the presence of
particular hormonal disorders and other chronic diseases or as a result of smoking and medications,
specifically glucocorticoids.[12] Osteoporosis usually has no symptoms until a fracture occurs.[12] For this
reason, DEXA scans are often done in people with one or more risk factors, who have developed
osteoporosis and be at risk of fracture.[12]
Osteoporosis treatment includes advice to stop smoking, decrease alcohol consumption, exercise regularly,
and have a healthy diet. Calcium supplements may also be advised, as may vitamin D. When medication is
used, it may include bisphosphonates, strontium ranelate, and osteoporosis may be one factor considered

Suśruta-saṃhitā, composed between 6th century BCE and 5th century CE speaks of 360 bones. Books on
Salya-Shastra (surgical science) know of only 300. The text then lists the total of 300 as follows: 120 in the
extremities (e.g. hands, legs), 117 in the pelvic area, sides, back, abdomen and breast, and 63 in the neck
and upwards.[14] The text then explains how these subtotals were empirically verified.[15] The discussion
shows that the Indian tradition nurtured diversity of thought, with Sushruta school reaching its own
conclusions and differing from the Atreya-Caraka tradition.[15] The differences in the count of bones in the
two schools is partly because Charaka Samhita includes thirty two teeth sockets in its count, and their
difference of opinions on how and when to count a cartilage as bone (both count cartilages as bones, unlike
current medical practice).[16]
The study of bones in ancient Greece started under Ptolemaic kings due to their link to Egypt. Herophilos,
through his work by studying dissected human corpses in Alexandria, is credited to be the pioneer of the
field. His works are lost but are often cited by notable persons in the field such as Galen and Rufus of
Ephesus. Galen himself did little dissection though and relied on the work of others like Marinus of
Alexandria,[17] as well as his own observations of gladiator cadavers and animals.[18] According to
Katherine Park, in medieval Europe dissection continued to be practiced, contrary to the popular
understanding that such practices were taboo and thus completely banned.[19] The practice of holy autopsy,
such as in the case of Clare of Montefalco further supports the claim.[20] Alexandria continued as a center
of anatomy under Islamic rule, with Ibn Zuhr a notable figure. Chinese understandings are divergent, as the
closest corresponding concept in the medicinal system seems to be the meridians, although given that Hua
Tuo regularly performed surgery, there may be some distance between medical theory and actual
understanding.
Leonardo da Vinci made studies of the skeleton, albeit unpublished in his time.[21] Many artists, Antonio
del Pollaiuolo being the first, performed dissections for better understanding of the body, although they
concentrated mostly on the muscles.[22] Vesalius, regarded as the founder of modern anatomy, authored the
book De humani corporis fabrica, which contained many illustrations of the skeleton and other body parts,
correcting some theories dating from Galen, such as the lower jaw being a single bone instead of two.[23]
Various other figures like Alessandro Achillini also contributed to the further understanding of the skeleton.
