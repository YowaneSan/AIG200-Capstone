Duodenum
The duodenum is the first section of the small intestine[3] in
most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds.
In mammals it may be the principal site for iron absorption. The
duodenum precedes the jejunum and ileum and is the shortest
part of the small intestine.
In humans, the duodenum is a hollow jointed tube about 25–38
centimetres (10–15 inches) long connecting the stomach to the
middle part of the small intestine.[4][5] It begins with the
duodenal bulb and ends at the suspensory muscle of
duodenum.[6] Duodenum can be divided into four parts: the
first (superior), the second (descending), the third (transverse)
and the fourth (ascending) parts.[5]
The duodenum is the first section of the small intestine in most
higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds. In
fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear, and the
terms anterior intestine or proximal intestine may be used
instead of duodenum.[7] In mammals the duodenum may be the
principal site for iron absorption.[8]
In humans, the duodenum is a C-shaped hollow jointed tube,
25–38 centimetres (10–15 inches) in length, lying adjacent to
the stomach (and connecting it to the small intestine). It is
divided anatomically into four sections. The first part lies within
the peritoneum but its other parts are retroperitoneal.[9]: 
273 
The first part, or superior part, of the duodenum is a
continuation from the pylorus to the transpyloric plane. It is
superior to the rest of the segments, at the vertebral level of L1.
The duodenal bulb, about 2 cm (3⁄4 in) long, is the first part of
the duodenum and is slightly dilated. The duodenal bulb is a
remnant of the mesoduodenum, a mesentery that suspends the
organ from the posterior abdominal wall in fetal life.[10] The
first part of the duodenum is mobile, and connected to the liver
by the hepatoduodenal ligament of the lesser omentum. The
first part of the duodenum ends at the corner, the superior
duodenal flexure.[9]:

The second part, or descending part, of the duodenum begins
at the superior duodenal flexure. It goes inferior to the lower
border of vertebral body L3, before making a sharp turn
medially into the inferior duodenal flexure, the end of the
descending part.[9]: 
274 
The pancreatic duct and common bile duct enter the descending
duodenum, through the major duodenal papilla. The second
part of the duodenum also contains the minor duodenal papilla,
the entrance for the accessory pancreatic duct. The junction
between the embryological foregut and midgut lies just below
the major duodenal papilla.[9]: 
274 
The third part, or horizontal part or inferior part of the
duodenum is 10~12  cm in length. It begins at the inferior
duodenal flexure and passes transversely to the left, passing in front of the inferior vena cava, abdominal
aorta and the vertebral column. The superior mesenteric artery and vein are anterior to the third part of the
duodenum.[9]: 
274  This part may be compressed between the aorta and SMA causing superior mesenteric
artery syndrome.
The fourth part, or ascending part, of the duodenum passes upward, joining with the jejunum at the
duodenojejunal flexure. The fourth part of the duodenum is at the vertebral level L3, and may pass directly
on top, or slightly to the left, of the aorta.[9]: 
274 
Blood supply
The duodenum receives arterial blood from two different sources. The transition between these sources is
important as it demarcates the foregut from the midgut. Proximal to the 2nd part of the duodenum
(approximately at the major duodenal papilla – where the bile duct enters) the arterial supply is from the
gastroduodenal artery and its branch the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery. Distal to this point (the
midgut) the arterial supply is from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and its branch the inferior
pancreaticoduodenal artery supplies the 3rd and 4th sections. The superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal
arteries (from the gastroduodenal artery and SMA respectively) form an anastomotic loop between the
celiac trunk and the SMA; so there is potential for collateral circulation here.
The venous drainage of the duodenum follows the arteries. Ultimately these veins drain into the portal
system, either directly or indirectly through the splenic or superior mesenteric vein and then to the portal
vein.
The lymphatic vessels follow the arteries in a retrograde fashion. The anterior lymphatic vessels drain into
the pancreatoduodenal lymph nodes located along the superior and inferior pancreatoduodenal arteries and
then into the pyloric lymph nodes (along the gastroduodenal artery). The posterior lymphatic vessels pass
posterior to the head of the pancreas and drain into the superior mesenteric lymph nodes. Efferent lymphatic
vessels from the duodenal lymph nodes ultimately pass into the celiac lymph nodes.
Under microscopy, the duodenum has a villous mucosa. This is distinct from the mucosa of the pylorus,
which directly joins the duodenum. Like other structures of the gastrointestinal tract, the duodenum has a
mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa, and adventitia. Glands line the duodenum, known as Brunner's
glands, which secrete mucus and bicarbonate in order to neutralise stomach acids. These are distinct glands
not found in the ileum or jejunum, the other parts of the small intestine.[11]:

The duodenum's close anatomical association with the pancreas creates differences in function based on the
position and orientation of the organs. The congenital abnormality, annular pancreas, causes a portion of the
pancreas to encircle the duodenum. In an extramural annular pancreas, the pancreatic duct encircles the
duodenum which results in gastrointestinal obstruction. An intramural annular pancreas is characterized by
pancreatic tissue that is fused with the duodenal wall, causing duodenal ulceration.[12]
About 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and 70% of these genes are expressed in
the normal duodenum.[13][14] Some 300 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the duodenum
with very few genes expressed only in the duodenum. The corresponding specific proteins are expressed in
the duodenal mucosa, and many of these are also expressed in the small intestine, such as alanine
aminopeptidase, a digestive enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme, involved in controlling blood
pressure, and RBP2, a protein involved in the uptake of vitamin A.[15]
The duodenum is largely responsible for the breakdown of food in the small intestine, using enzymes. The
duodenum also regulates the rate of emptying of the stomach via hormonal pathways. Secretin and
cholecystokinin are released from cells in the duodenal epithelium in response to acidic and fatty stimuli

Gene and protein expression
Function
present there when the pylorus opens and emits gastric chyme into the duodenum for further digestion.
These cause the liver and gallbladder to release bile, and the pancreas to release bicarbonate and digestive
enzymes such as trypsin, lipase and amylase into the duodenum as they are needed.
The villi of the duodenum have a leafy-looking appearance, which is a histologically identifiable structure.
Brunner's glands, which secrete mucus, are only found in the duodenum. The duodenum wall consists of a
very thin layer of cells that form the muscularis mucosae.
Ulcers of the duodenum commonly occur because of infection by the bacteria Helicobacter pylori. These
bacteria, through a number of mechanisms, erode the protective mucosa of the duodenum, predisposing it to
damage from gastric acids. The first part of the duodenum is the most common location of ulcers since it is
where the acidic chyme meets the duodenal mucosa before mixing with the alkaline secretions of the
duodenum.[16] Duodenal ulcers may cause recurrent abdominal pain and dyspepsia, and are often
investigated using a urea breath test to test for the bacteria, and endoscopy to confirm ulceration and take a
biopsy. If managed, these are often managed through antibiotics that aim to eradicate the bacteria, and
proton-pump inhibitors and antacids to reduce the gastric acidity.[17]
The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines specify that a duodenal biopsy is required for the
diagnosis of adult celiac disease. The biopsy is ideally performed at a moment when the patient is on a
gluten-containing diet.[18]
Duodenal cancer is a cancer in the first section of the small intestine. Cancer of the duodenum is relatively
rare compared to stomach cancer and colorectal cancer; malignant tumors in the duodenum constitute only
around 0.3% of all the gastrointestinal tract tumors but around half of cancerous tissues that develop in the
small intestine.[19] Its histology is often observed to be adenocarcinoma, meaning that the cancerous tissue
arises from glandular cells in the epithelial tissue lining the duodenum.[20]
Inflammation of the duodenum is referred to as duodenitis. There are multiple known causes.[21] Celiac
disease and inflammatory bowel disease are two of the known causes.[22]
The name duodenum is Medieval Latin, short for intestīnum duodēnum digitōrum, meaning intestine of
twelve finger-widths (in length), genitive pl. of duodēnī, twelve each, from Latin duodeni "twelve each"
(from duodecim "twelve"). Coined by Gerard of Cremona (d. 1187) in his Latin translation of "Canon

Etymology
Avicennae," "عشر اثنا" itself a loan-translation of Greek dodekadaktylon, literally "twelve fingers long."
The intestine part was so called by the Greek physician Herophilus (c. 335–280 BCE) for its length, about
equal to the breadth of 12 fingers.[23]
Many languages retain a similar etymology for this word. For example, German Zwölffingerdarm, Dutch
Twaalfvingerige darm and Turkish Oniki parmak bağırsağı.
