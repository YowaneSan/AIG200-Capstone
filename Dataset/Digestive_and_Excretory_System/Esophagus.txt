Esophagus
The esophagus (American English) or oesophagus (British
English, see spelling differences; both /iːˈsɒfəɡəs, ɪ-/;[1] pl.:
(o)esophagi or (o)esophaguses), colloquially known also as the
food pipe, food tube, or gullet, is an organ in vertebrates through
which food passes, aided by peristaltic contractions, from the
pharynx to the stomach. The esophagus is a fibromuscular tube,
about 25 cm (10 in) long in adults, that travels behind the trachea
and heart, passes through the diaphragm, and empties into the
uppermost region of the stomach. During swallowing, the epiglottis
tilts backwards to prevent food from going down the larynx and
lungs. The word oesophagus is from Ancient Greek οἰσοφάγος
(oisophágos), from οἴσω (oísō), future form of φέρω (phérō, "I
carry") + ἔφαγον (éphagon, "I ate").
The wall of the esophagus from the lumen outwards consists of
mucosa, submucosa (connective tissue), layers of muscle fibers
between layers of fibrous tissue, and an outer layer of connective
tissue. The mucosa is a stratified squamous epithelium of around
three layers of squamous cells, which contrasts to the single layer
of columnar cells of the stomach. The transition between these two
types of epithelium is visible as a zig-zag line. Most of the muscle
is smooth muscle although striated muscle predominates in its
upper third. It has two muscular rings or sphincters in its wall, one
at the top and one at the bottom. The lower sphincter helps to
prevent reflux of acidic stomach content. The esophagus has a rich
blood supply and venous drainage. Its smooth muscle is innervated
by involuntary nerves (sympathetic nerves via the sympathetic
trunk and parasympathetic nerves via the vagus nerve) and in
addition voluntary nerves (lower motor neurons) which are carried
in the vagus nerve to innervate its striated muscle.
The esophagus passes through the thoracic cavity into the
diaphragm into the stomach.
The esophagus may be affected by gastric reflux, cancer,
prominent dilated blood vessels called varices that can bleed
heavily, tears, constrictions, and disorders of motility. Diseases may
cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), painful swallowing
(odynophagia), chest pain, or cause no symptoms at all. Clinical
investigations include X-rays when swallowing barium sulfate,

Anatomical terminology
Upper and lower human gastrointestinal tract
endoscopy, and CT scans. Surgically, the esophagus is difficult to
access in part due to its position between critical organs and
directly between the sternum and spinal column.[2]
The esophagus is one of the upper parts of the digestive system.
There are taste buds on its upper part.[3] It
begins at the back of the mouth, passing
downward through the rear part of the
mediastinum, through the diaphragm, and into
the stomach. In humans, the esophagus generally
starts around the level of the sixth cervical
vertebra behind the cricoid cartilage of the
trachea, enters the diaphragm at about the level
of the tenth thoracic vertebra, and ends at the
cardia of the stomach, at the level of the eleventh
thoracic vertebra.[4] The esophagus is usually
about 25 cm (10 in) in length.[5]
Many blood vessels serve the esophagus, with
blood supply varying along its course. The
upper parts of the esophagus and the upper
esophageal sphincter receive blood from the
inferior thyroid artery, the parts of the esophagus
in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and
branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the
lower parts of the esophagus and the lower
esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left
gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic
artery.[6][7] The venous drainage also differs
along the course of the esophagus. The upper
and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the
azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from
the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, with the
exception of the left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein.[6] Lymphatically, the upper third of
the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior
mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar
to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the
celiac nodes.[6]
Position
The upper esophagus lies at the back of the mediastinum behind the trachea, adjoining along the
tracheoesophageal stripe, and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column. The lower
esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta. From the bifurcation of the trachea
downwards, the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At
this point, it passes through the diaphragm.[4]

Seen from behind.
The esophagus is constricted in
three places.
The thoracic duct, which drains the
majority of the body's lymph, passes
behind the esophagus, curving from
lying behind the esophagus on the
right in the lower part of the
esophagus, to lying behind the
esophagus on the left in the upper
esophagus. The esophagus also lies in
front of parts of the hemiazygos veins
and the intercostal veins on the right
side. The vagus nerve divides and
covers the esophagus in a plexus.[4]
Constrictions
The esophagus has four points of
constriction. 
When 
a 
corrosive
substance, or a solid object is swallowed, it is most likely to lodge
and damage one of these four points. These constrictions arise from
particular structures that compress the esophagus. These
constrictions are:[8]
At the start of the esophagus, where the laryngopharynx
joins the esophagus, behind the cricoid cartilage
Where it is crossed on the front by the aortic arch in the
superior mediastinum
Where the esophagus is compressed by the left main
bronchus in the posterior mediastinum
The esophageal hiatus, where it passes through the
diaphragm in the posterior mediastinum
The esophagus is surrounded at the top and bottom by two muscular rings, known respectively as the upper
esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter.[4] These sphincters act to close the esophagus
when food is not being swallowed. The upper esophageal sphincter is an anatomical sphincter, which is
formed by the lower portion of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor, also known as the cricopharyngeal
sphincter due to its relation with cricoid cartilage of the larynx anteriorly. However, the lower esophageal
sphincter is not an anatomical but rather a functional sphincter, meaning that it acts as a sphincter but does
not have a distinct thickening like other sphincters.
The upper esophageal sphincter surrounds the upper part of the esophagus. It consists of skeletal muscle but
is not under voluntary control. Opening of the upper esophageal sphincter is triggered by the swallowing
reflex. The primary muscle of the upper esophageal sphincter is the cricopharyngeal part of the inferior
pharyngeal constrictor.[9]
The lower esophageal sphincter, or gastroesophageal sphincter, surrounds the lower part of the esophagus at
the junction between the esophagus and the stomach.[10] It is also called the cardiac sphincter or
cardioesophageal sphincter, named from the adjacent part of the stomach, the cardia. Dysfunction of the
Sphincters
gastroesophageal sphincter causes gastroesophageal reflux, which causes heartburn, and, if it happens often
enough, can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease, with damage of the esophageal mucosa.[11]
The esophagus is innervated by the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk.[6] The
vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying the muscles of the esophagus and stimulating
glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles. The upper
striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus
ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies
situated in the dorsal motor nucleus.[6] The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis.[12]
The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve,
increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic
activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction.[6] Sensation along the esophagus
is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the
sympathetic trunk.[4]
The gastroesophageal junction (also known as the esophagogastric junction) is the junction between the
esophagus and the stomach, at the lower end of the esophagus.[13] The pink color of the esophageal
mucosa contrasts to the deeper red of the gastric mucosa,[6][14] and the mucosal transition can be seen as an
irregular zig-zag line, which is often called the z-line.[15] Histological examination reveals abrupt transition
between the stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus and the simple columnar epithelium of the
stomach.[16] Normally, the cardia of the stomach is immediately distal to the z-line[17] and the z-line
coincides with the upper limit of the gastric folds of the cardia; however, when the anatomy of the mucosa
is distorted in Barrett's esophagus the true gastroesophageal junction can be identified by the upper limit of
the gastric folds rather than the mucosal transition.[18] The functional location of the lower oesophageal
sphincter is generally situated about 3 cm (11⁄4 in) below the z-line.[6]
The human esophagus has a mucous membrane consisting of a tough stratified squamous epithelium
without keratin, a smooth lamina propria, and a muscularis mucosae.[6] The epithelium of the esophagus
has a relatively rapid turnover and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food. In many
animals, the epithelium contains a layer of keratin, representing a coarser diet.[19] There are two types of
glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa and esophageal cardiac
glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the
terminal part of the organ.[19][20] The mucus from the glands gives a good protection to the lining.[21] The
submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus, a network of nerve cells that is part of the enteric nervous
system.[19]
The muscular layer of the esophagus has two types of muscle. The upper third of the esophagus contains
striated muscle, the lower third contains smooth muscle, and the middle third contains a mixture of both.[6]
Muscle is arranged in two layers: one in which the muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus, and the
other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus. These are separated by the myenteric plexus, a tangled
network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the
Nerve supply

esophagus. The outermost layer of the
esophagus is the adventitia in most of its
length, with the abdominal part being
covered in serosa. This makes it distinct
from many other structures in the
gastrointestinal tract that only have a
serosa.[6]
In early embryogenesis, the esophagus
develops from the endodermal primitive
gut tube. The ventral part of the embryo
abuts the yolk sac. During the second
week of embryological development, as
the embryo grows, it begins to surround
parts of the sac. The enveloped portions
form 
the 
basis 
for 
the 
adult
gastrointestinal tract.[22] The sac is
surrounded by a network of vitelline
arteries. 
Over 
time, 
these 
arteries
consolidate into the three main arteries
that 
supply 
the 
developing
gastrointestinal tract: the celiac artery,
superior mesenteric artery, and inferior
mesenteric artery. The areas supplied by
these arteries are used to define the
midgut, hindgut and foregut.[22]
The surrounded sac becomes the
primitive gut. Sections of this gut begin
to differentiate into the organs of the
gastrointestinal 
tract, 
such 
as 
the
esophagus, stomach, and intestines.[22]
The esophagus develops as part of the
foregut tube.[22] The innervation of the
esophagus develops from the pharyngeal arches.[4]
Food is ingested through the mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx and then into the
esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the
gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach.[10] When food is being
swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea.
Development
Function
Swallowing
At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic
contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions
occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also as a response to the sensation of food
within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.[10]
The stomach produces gastric acid, a strongly acidic mixture consisting of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and
potassium and sodium salts to enable food digestion. Constriction of the upper and lower esophageal
sphincters helps to prevent reflux (backflow) of gastric contents and acid into the esophagus, protecting the
esophageal mucosa. The acute angle of His and the lower crura of the diaphragm also help this sphincteric
action.[10][23]
About 20,000 protein-coding genes are expressed in human cells and nearly 70% of these genes are
expressed in the normal esophagus.[24][25] Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the
esophagus with less than 50 genes being highly specific. The corresponding esophagus-specific proteins are
mainly involved in squamous differentiation such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. Other specific
proteins that help lubricate the inner surface of esophagus are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22. Many
genes with elevated expression are also shared with skin and other organs that are composed of squamous
epithelia.[26]
The main conditions affecting the esophagus are described here. For a more complete list, see esophageal
disease.
Inflammation of the esophagus is known as esophagitis. Reflux of gastric acids from the stomach, infection,
substances ingested (for example, corrosives), some medications (such as bisphosphonates), and food
allergies can all lead to esophagitis. Esophageal candidiasis is an infection of the yeast Candida albicans
that may occur when a person is immunocompromised. As of 2021 the causes of some forms of esophagitis,
such as eosinophilic esophagitis, are not well-characterized, but may include Th2-mediated atopies or
genetic factors. There appear to be correlations between eosinophilic esophagitis, asthma (itself with an
eosinophilic component), eczema, and allergic rhinitis, though it is not clear whether these conditions
contribute to eosinophilic esophagitis or vice versa, or if they are symptoms of mutual underlying
factors.[27] Esophagitis can cause painful swallowing and is usually treated by managing the cause of the
esophagitis - such as managing reflux or treating infection.[5]

Inflammation
Barrett's esophagus
Prolonged esophagitis, particularly from gastric reflux, is one factor thought to play a role in the
development of Barrett's esophagus. In this condition, there is metaplasia of the lining of the lower
esophagus, which changes from stratified squamous epithelia to simple columnar epithelia. Barrett's
esophagus is thought to be one of the main contributors to the development of esophageal cancer.[5]
There are two main types of cancer of the esophagus. Squamous cell carcinoma is a carcinoma that can
occur in the squamous cells lining the esophagus. This type is much more common in China and Iran. The
other main type is an adenocarcinoma that occurs in the glands or columnar tissue of the esophagus. This is
most common in developed countries in those with Barrett's esophagus, and occurs in the cuboidal cells.[5]
In its early stages, esophageal cancer may not have any symptoms at all. When severe, esophageal cancer
may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult
and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the
esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any
metastases in different parts of the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy,
chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus. Inserting a stent into
the esophagus, or inserting a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest
enough food and water. As of 2014, the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor, so palliative therapy
may also be a focus of treatment.[5]
Esophageal varices are swollen twisted branches of the azygous vein in the lower third of the esophagus.
These blood vessels anastomose (join up) with those of the portal vein when portal hypertension
develops.[28] These blood vessels are engorged more than normal, and in the worst cases may partially
obstruct the esophagus. These blood vessels develop as part of a collateral circulation that occurs to drain
blood from the abdomen as a result of portal hypertension, usually as a result of liver diseases such as
cirrhosis.[5]: 
941–42  This collateral circulation occurs because the lower part of the esophagus drains into the
left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Because of the extensive venous plexus that exists
between this vein and other veins, if portal hypertension occurs, the direction of blood drainage in this vein
may reverse, with blood draining from the portal venous system, through the plexus. Veins in the plexus
may engorge and lead to varices.[6][7]
Esophageal varices often do not have symptoms until they rupture. A ruptured varix is considered a medical
emergency because varices can bleed a lot. A bleeding varix may cause a person to vomit blood, or suffer
shock. To deal with a ruptured varix, a band may be placed around the bleeding blood vessel, or a small
amount of a clotting agent may be injected near the bleed. A surgeon may also try to use a small inflatable
balloon to apply pressure to stop the wound. IV fluids and blood products may be given in order to prevent
hypovolemia from excess blood loss.[5]
Several disorders affect the motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult
swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia refers to a failure of
the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to

progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus
refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus
that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in
esophageal conditions.[29] Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST
syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.[5]
Esophageal strictures are usually benign and typically develop after a person has had reflux for many years.
Other strictures may include esophageal webs (which can also be congenital) and damage to the esophagus
by radiotherapy, corrosive ingestion, or eosinophilic esophagitis. A Schatzki ring is fibrosis at the
gastroesophageal junction. Strictures may also develop in chronic anemia, and Plummer-Vinson
syndrome.[5]
Two of the most common congenital malformations affecting the esophagus are an esophageal atresia
where the esophagus ends in a blind sac instead of connecting to the stomach; and an esophageal fistula –
an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea.[30] Both of these conditions usually occur
together.[30] These are found in about 1 in 3500 births.[31] Half of these cases may be part of a syndrome
where other abnormalities are also present, particularly of the heart or limbs. The other cases occur
singly.[32]
An X-ray of swallowed barium may be used to reveal the size and
shape of the esophagus, and the presence of any masses. The
esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into
the esophagus, in a procedure called an endoscopy. If an endoscopy
is used on the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through
the esophagus. During an endoscopy, a biopsy may be taken. If
cancer of the esophagus is being investigated, other methods,
including a CT scan, may also be used.[5]
The word esophagus (British English: oesophagus), comes from
the Greek: οἰσοφάγος (oisophagos) meaning gullet. It derives from
two roots (eosin) to carry and (phagos) to eat.[33] The use of the
word oesophagus, has been documented in anatomical literature
since at least the time of Hippocrates, who noted that "the
oesophagus  ... receives the greatest amount of what we
consume."[34] Its existence in other animals and its relationship with
the stomach was documented by the Roman naturalist Pliny the
Elder (AD23–AD79),[35] and the peristaltic contractions of the
esophagus have been documented since at least the time of
Galen.[36]

The first attempt at surgery on the esophagus focused in the neck, and was conducted in dogs by Theodore
Billroth in 1871. In 1877 Czerny carried out surgery in people. By 1908, an operation had been performed
by Voeckler to remove the esophagus, and in 1933 the first surgical removal of parts of the lower
esophagus, (to control esophageal cancer), had been conducted.[37]
The Nissen fundoplication, in which the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter to
stimulate its function and control reflux, was first conducted by Rudolph Nissen in 1955.[37]
In tetrapods, the pharynx is much shorter, and the esophagus
correspondingly longer, than in fish. In the majority of vertebrates, the
esophagus is simply a connecting tube, but in some birds, which
regurgitate components to feed their young, it is extended towards the
lower end to form a crop for storing food before it enters the true
stomach.[39][40] In ruminants, animals with four stomachs, a groove
called the sulcus reticuli is often found in the esophagus, allowing milk
to drain directly into the hind stomach, the abomasum.[41] In the horse
the esophagus is about 1.2 to 1.5 m (4 to 5 ft) in length, and carries
food to the stomach. A muscular ring, called the cardiac sphincter,
connects the stomach to the esophagus. This sphincter is very well
developed in horses. This and the oblique angle at which the
esophagus connects to the stomach explains why horses cannot
vomit.[42] The esophagus is also the area of the digestive tract where
horses may have the condition known as choke.
The esophagus of snakes is remarkable for the distension it undergoes
when swallowing prey.[43]
In most fish, the esophagus is extremely short, primarily due to the
length of the pharynx (which is associated with the gills). However,
some fish, including lampreys, chimaeras, and lungfish, have no true
stomach, so that the esophagus effectively runs from the pharynx
directly to the intestine, and is therefore somewhat longer.[39]
In many vertebrates, the esophagus is lined by stratified squamous
epithelium without glands. In fish, the esophagus is often lined with
columnar epithelium,[40] and in amphibians, sharks and rays, the
esophageal epithelium is ciliated, helping to wash food along, in
addition to the action of muscular peristalsis.[39] In addition, in the bat
Plecotus auritus, fish and some amphibians, glands secreting pepsinogen or hydrochloric acid have been
found.[40]

The muscle of the esophagus in many mammals is initially
striated but then becomes smooth muscle in the caudal
third or so. In canines and ruminants, however, it is
entirely striated to allow regurgitation to feed young
(canines) or regurgitation to chew cud (ruminants). It is
entirely smooth muscle in amphibians, reptiles and
birds.[40]
Contrary to popular belief,[44] an adult human body
would not be able to pass through the esophagus of a
whale, which generally measures less than 10 cm (4 in) in
diameter, although in larger baleen whales it may be up to
25 cm (10 in) when fully distended.[45]
A structure with the same name is often found in
invertebrates, 
including 
molluscs 
and 
arthropods,
connecting the oral cavity with the stomach.[46] In terms
of the digestive system of snails and slugs, the mouth
opens into an esophagus, which connects to the stomach.
Because of torsion, which is the rotation of the main body
of the animal during larval development, the esophagus
usually passes around the stomach, and opens into its
back, furthest from the mouth. In species that have
undergone de-torsion, however, the esophagus may open
into the anterior of the stomach, which is the reverse of the
usual gastropod arrangement.[47] There is an extensive
rostrum at the front of the esophagus in all carnivorous snails and slugs.[48] In the freshwater snail species
Tarebia granifera, the brood pouch is above the esophagus.[49]
In the cephalopods, the brain often surrounds the esophagus.[50]
