Suspensory muscle of duodenum
The suspensory muscle of duodenum (also known as
suspensory ligament of duodenum, Treitz's muscle or
ligament of Treitz[1]) is a thin muscle connecting the junction
between the duodenum and jejunum (the small intestine's first
and second parts, respectively), as well as the duodenojejunal
flexure to connective tissue surrounding the superior mesenteric
and coeliac arteries. The suspensory muscle most often
connects to both the third and fourth parts of the duodenum, as
well as the duodenojejunal flexure, although the attachment is
quite variable.
The suspensory muscle marks the formal division between the
duodenum and the jejunum. This division is used to mark the
difference between the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts,
which is relevant in clinical medicine as it may determine the
source of gastrointestinal bleeding.
The suspensory muscle is derived from mesoderm and plays a
role in the embryological rotation of the gut, by offering a point
of fixation for the rotating gut. It is also thought to help
digestion by widening the angle of the duodenojejunal flexure.
Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a rare abnormality
caused by a congenitally short suspensory muscle.
The duodenum and the jejunum are the first and second parts of
the small intestine, respectively. The suspensory muscle of the
duodenum marks their formal division.[2] The suspensory
muscle arises from the right crus of the diaphragm as it passes
around the esophagus, continues as connective tissue around
the stems of the celiac trunk (celiac artery) and superior
mesenteric artery, passes behind the pancreas, and enters the
upper part of the mesentery, inserting into the junction between
the duodenum and jejunum, the duodenojejunal flexure.[3]
Here, the muscles are continuous with the muscular layers of
the duodenum.[1]

Anatomical terms of muscle
Considerable anatomic variation exists, in terms of length and
point of attachment.[4] Despite the classical description, the
muscle only solely attaches to the duodenojejunal flexure in
about 8% of people; it is far more common, 40 to 60% of the
time to attach additionally to the third and fourth parts of the
duodenum; and 20 to 30% of the time it only attaches to the
third and fourth parts. Moreover, separate multiple attachments
are not that uncommon.[1]
According to some authors, who use the original description by
Treitz, the muscle may be divided into two sections: a
ligamentous portion attaching the right crus of diaphragm to the
connective tissue surrounding the coeliac artery and superior
mesenteric artery; and a lower muscular portion from the
connective tissue attaching to the duodenum. The superior
portion is also described as the Hilfsmuskel.[3][4] These two
parts are now considered anatomically distinct, with the
suspensory muscle referring solely to the lower structure
attaching at the duodenum.[1][4]
The ligament contains a slender band of skeletal muscle from
the diaphragm and a fibromuscular band of smooth muscle
from the horizontal and ascending parts of the duodenum.
When it contracts, by virtue of connections to the third and fourth parts of the duodenum, the suspensory
muscle of the duodenum widens the angle of the duodenojejunal flexure, allowing movement of the
intestinal contents.[1][5]
Embryologically, the suspensory muscle of the duodenum is derived from mesoderm. It plays an important
role in the embryological rotation of the small intestine as the superior retention band.[1][3]:

This ligament is an important anatomical landmark of the duodenojejunal flexure, separating the upper and
lower gastrointestinal tracts. For example, bloody vomit or melena, black tarry stools, usually indicate a
gastrointestinal bleed from a location in the upper gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, hematochezia, bright red
blood or clots in the stool, usually indicates gastrointestinal bleeding from the lower part of the
gastrointestinal tract.[6] It is an especially important landmark to note when looking at the bowel for the
presence of malrotation of the gut, a syndrome often suspected in young children when they have episodes
of recurrent vomiting. Visualising a normal location of the ligament of Treitz in radiological images is
critical in ruling out malrotation of the gut in a child; it is abnormally located when malrotation is present.[4]

Clinical significance
During a Whipple's procedure, commonly used to treat pancreatic cancer by removing the pancreas,
duodenum, and part of the jejunum, the ligament of Treitz is separated from the duodenum and preserved.
When the remaining jejunum is anastamosed with the pylorus of the stomach, it may be passed through the
ligament.[7]
Superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMA) is an extremely rare life-threatening condition that can either
be congenital and chronic, or induced and acute. SMA Syndrome is characterised by compression of the
duodenum between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery, and may—when congenital—
result from a short suspensory muscle. One surgical treatment is Strong's operation, which involves cutting
the suspensory muscle, though this is not often carried out.[8]
The suspensory muscle of the duodenum was first named in 1853 by Václav Treitz, as the musculus
suspensorius duodeni (in Latin), and described as consisting of a lower muscular portion with a broad base,
and an upper tendinous portion blending with connective tissue around the origins of the superior
mesenteric and coeliac arteries. It is commonly termed the ligament of Treitz by clinicians and as the
suspensory muscle of the duodenum by anatomists. It has also been likened to "a polar ice cap ... a structure
that many refer to but few have seen."[1]
