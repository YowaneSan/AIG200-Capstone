Anatomical terminology
Development of the mouth and anus in
protostomes and deuterostomes
Mouth
The mouth is the body orifice through which many animals
ingest food and vocalize. The body cavity immediately behind
the mouth opening, known as the oral cavity (or cavum oris in
Latin),[2] is also the first part of the alimentary canal, which
leads to the pharynx and the gullet. In tetrapod vertebrates, the
mouth is bounded on the outside by the lips and cheeks — thus
the oral cavity is also known as the buccal cavity (from Latin
bucca, meaning "cheek")[3] — and contains the tongue on the
inside. Except for some groups like birds and lissamphibians,
vertebrates usually have teeth in their mouths,[4] although some
fish species have pharyngeal teeth instead of oral teeth.
Most bilaterian phyla, including arthropods, molluscs and
chordates, have a two-opening gut tube with a mouth at one
end and an anus at the other. Which end forms first in ontogeny
is a criterion used to classify bilaterian animals into protostomes
and deuterostomes.
In the first multicellular animals, there was probably no mouth
or gut and food particles were engulfed by the cells on the exterior surface by a process known as
endocytosis. The particles became enclosed in vacuoles into which enzymes were secreted and digestion
took place intracellularly. The digestive products were absorbed into the cytoplasm and diffused into other
cells. This form of digestion is used nowadays by simple organisms such as Amoeba and Paramecium and
also by sponges which, despite their large size, have no mouth or gut and capture their food by
endocytosis.[5]
Development
Butterfly tongue
However, most animals have a mouth and a gut, the lining of which is continuous with the epithelial cells
on the surface of the body. A few animals which live parasitically originally had guts but have secondarily
lost these structures. The original gut of diploblastic animals probably consisted of a mouth and a one-way
gut. Some modern invertebrates still have such a system: food being ingested through the mouth, partially
broken down by enzymes secreted in the gut, and the resulting particles engulfed by the other cells in the
gut lining. Indigestible waste is ejected through the mouth.[5]
In animals at least as complex as an earthworm, the embryo forms a dent on one side, the blastopore, which
deepens to become the archenteron, the first phase in the formation of the gut. In deuterostomes, the
blastopore becomes the anus while the gut eventually tunnels through to make another opening, which
forms the mouth. In the protostomes, it used to be thought that the blastopore formed the mouth (proto–
meaning "first") while the anus formed later as an opening made by the other end of the gut. More recent
research, however, shows that in protostomes the edges of the slit-like blastopore close up in the middle,
leaving openings at both ends that become the mouth and anus.[6]
Apart from sponges and placozoans, almost all animals have an
internal gut cavity, which is lined with gastrodermal cells. In less
advanced invertebrates such as the sea anemone, the mouth also
acts as an anus. Circular muscles around the mouth are able to relax
or contract in order to open or close it. A fringe of tentacles thrusts
food into the cavity and it can gape widely enough to accommodate
large prey items. Food passes first into a pharynx and digestion
occurs extracellularly in the gastrovascular cavity.[7] Annelids have
simple tube-like guts, and the possession of an anus allows them to
separate the digestion of their foodstuffs from the absorption of the
nutrients.[8] Many molluscs have a radula, which is used to scrape
microscopic particles off surfaces.[9] In invertebrates with hard exoskeletons, various mouthparts may be
involved in feeding behaviour. Insects have a range of mouthparts suited to their mode of feeding. These
include mandibles, maxillae and labium and can be modified into suitable appendages for chewing, cutting,
piercing, sponging and sucking.[10] Decapods have six pairs of mouth appendages, one pair of mandibles,
two pairs of maxillae and three of maxillipeds.[11] Sea urchins have a set of five sharp calcareous plates,
which are used as jaws and are known as Aristotle's lantern.[12]
In vertebrates, the first part of the digestive system is the buccal cavity, commonly known as the mouth. The
buccal cavity of a fish is separated from the opercular cavity by the gills. Water flows in through the mouth,
passes over the gills and exits via the operculum or gill slits. Nearly all fish have jaws and may seize food
with them but most feed by opening their jaws, expanding their pharynx and sucking in food items. The
food may be held or chewed by teeth located in the jaws, on the roof of the mouth, on the pharynx or on the
gill arches.[13]
Anatomy
Invertebrates
Vertebrates
Litoria chloris calling
Nearly all amphibians are carnivorous as adults. Many catch their
prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and
drawing it back into the mouth, where they hold the prey with their
jaws. They then swallow their food whole without much
chewing.[14] They typically have many small hinged pedicellate
teeth, the bases of which are attached to the jaws, while the crowns
break off at intervals and are replaced. Most amphibians have one
or two rows of teeth in both jaws but some frogs lack teeth in the
lower jaw. In many amphibians, there are also vomerine teeth
attached to the bone in the roof of the mouth.[15]
The mouths of reptiles are largely similar to those of mammals. The
crocodilians are the only reptiles to have teeth anchored in sockets in their jaws.[16] They are able to replace
each of their approximately 80 teeth up to 50 times during their lives.[17] Most reptiles are either
carnivorous or insectivorous, but turtles are often herbivorous. Lacking teeth that are suitable for efficiently
chewing of their food, turtles often have gastroliths in their stomach to further grind the plant material.[18]
Snakes have a very flexible lower jaw, the two halves of which are not rigidly attached, and numerous other
joints in their skull. These modifications allow them to open their mouths wide enough to swallow their
prey whole, even if it is wider than they are.[19]
Birds do not have teeth, relying instead on other means of gripping and macerating their food. Their beaks
have a range of sizes and shapes according to their diet and are composed of elongated mandibles. The
upper mandible may have a nasofrontal hinge allowing the beak to open wider than would otherwise be
possible. The exterior surface of beaks is composed of a thin, horny sheath of keratin.[20] Nectar feeders
such as hummingbirds have specially adapted brushy tongues for sucking up nectar from flowers.[21]
In mammals, the buccal cavity is typically roofed by the hard and soft palates, floored by the tongue and
surrounded by the cheeks, salivary glands, and upper and lower teeth. The upper teeth are embedded in the
upper jaw and the lower teeth in the lower jaw, which articulates with the temporal bones of the skull. The
lips are soft and fleshy folds which shape the entrance into the mouth. The buccal cavity empties through
the pharynx into the oesophagus.[22]
Crocodilians living in the tropics can gape with their mouths to provide cooling by evaporation from the
mouth lining.[23] Some mammals rely on panting for thermoregulation as it increases evaporation of water
across the moist surfaces of the lungs, the tongue and mouth. Birds also avoid overheating by gular
fluttering, flapping the wings near the gular (throat) skin, similar to panting in mammals.[24]
Various animals use their mouths in threat displays. They may gape widely, exhibit their teeth prominently,
or flash the startling colours of the mouth lining. This display allows each potential combatant an
opportunity to assess the weapons of their opponent and lessens the likelihood of actual combat being
necessary.[25]
A number of species of bird use a gaping, open beak in their fear and threat displays. Some augment the
display by hissing or breathing heavily, while others clap their beaks.[26]
Other functions of the mouth

Mouths are also used as part of the mechanism for producing
sounds for communication. To produce sounds, air is forced from
the lungs over vocal cords in the larynx. In humans, the pharynx,
soft palate, hard palate, alveolar ridge, tongue, teeth and lips are
termed articulators and play their part in the production of speech.
Varying the position of the tongue in relation to the other
articulators or moving the lips restricts the airflow from the lungs in
different ways and changes the mouth's resonating properties,
producing a range of different sounds.[27] In frogs, the sounds can
be amplified using sacs in the throat region. The vocal sacs can be
inflated and deflated and act as resonators to transfer the sound to
the outside world.[28] A bird's song is produced by the flow of air
over a vocal organ at the base of the trachea, the syrinx. For each
burst of song, the bird opens its beak and closes it again afterwards. The beak may move slightly and may
contribute to the resonance but the song originates elsewhere.[29]
