Cecum
The cecum, here in red, lies at the start
of the large intestines, which are shown
with the rest of the human
gastrointestinal tract in this image.

Cecum
The cecum or caecum is a pouch within the peritoneum that is
considered to be the beginning of the large intestine.[1] It is
typically located on the right side of the body (the same side of
the body as the appendix, to which it is joined). The word
cecum (/ˈsiːkəm/, plural ceca /ˈsiːkə/) stems from the Latin
caecus meaning blind.
It receives chyme from the ileum, and connects to the ascending
colon of the large intestine. It is separated from the ileum by the
ileocecal valve (ICV) or Bauhin's valve. It is also separated
from the colon by the cecocolic junction. While the cecum is
usually intraperitoneal, the ascending colon is retroperitoneal.[2]
In herbivores, the cecum stores food material where bacteria are
able to break down the cellulose. In humans, the cecum is
involved in absorption of salts and electrolytes and lubricates
the solid waste that passes into the large intestine.[3]
The cecum and appendix are derived from the bud of cecum
that forms during week 6 in the midgut next to the apex of the
umbilical herniation.[5] Specifically, the cecum and appendix
are formed by the enlargement of the postarterial segment of the
midgut loop. The proximal part of the bud grows rapidly to
form the cecum. The lateral wall of the cecum grows much
more rapidly than the medial wall, with the result that the point
of attachment of the appendix comes to lie on the medial side.
The cecum's position changes after the midgut rotates and the
ascending colon elongates, and the accumulation of meconium
inside the cecum may result in the latter's increased diameter.[5]
The term cecum comes from Latin (intestinum) caecum,
literally 'blind intestine', in the sense 'blind gut' or 'cul de sac'.[6]
It is a direct translation from Ancient Greek τυφλὸν (ἔντερον)

Anatomical terminology
Inner diameters of different sections
of the large intestine, with cecum (at
bottom left) measuring on average
8.7 cm (range 8.0-10.5 cm).[4]
typhlòn (énteron). Thus the inflammation of the cecum is called
typhlitis.
In dissections by the Greek philosophers, the connection
between the ileum of the small intestine and the cecum was not
fully understood. Most of the studies of the digestive tract were
done on animals and the results were compared to human
structures.[7]
The junction between the small intestine and the colon, called
the ileocecal valve, is so small in some animals that it was not
considered to be a connection between the small and large
intestines. During a dissection, the colon could be traced from
the rectum, to the sigmoid colon, through the descending,
transverse, and ascending sections. The cecum is an end point
for the colon with a dead-end portion terminating with the
appendix.[8]
The connection between the end of the small intestine (ileum)
and the start (as viewed from the perspective of food being
processed) of the colon (cecum) is now clearly understood, and
is called the ileocecal orifice. The connection between the end
of the cecum and the beginning of the ascending colon is called
the cecocolic orifice.
A cecal carcinoid tumor is a carcinoid tumor of the cecum. An
appendiceal carcinoid tumor (a carcinoid tumor of the appendix) is
sometimes found next to a cecal carcinoid.
Neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis) is the condition of inflammation
of the cecum, primarily caused by bacterial infections.
Over 99% of the bacteria in the gut are anaerobes,[9][10][11][12][13]
but in the cecum, aerobic bacteria reach high densities.[14]
A cecum is present in most amniote species, and also in lungfish, but not in any living species of amphibian.
In reptiles, it is usually a single median structure, arising from the dorsal side of the large intestine. Birds
typically have two paired ceca, as do, unlike other mammals, hyraxes.[15] Parrots do not have ceca.[16]
Most mammalian herbivores have a relatively large cecum. In many species, it is considerably wider than
the colon. For some herbivores (e.g., lagomorphs (rabbits, hares, pikas), easily digestible food is processed
in the gastrointestinal tract & expelled as regular feces. But in order to get nutrients out of hard to digest
fiber, lagomorphs ferment fiber in the cecum and then expel the contents as cecotropes, which are
reingested (cecotrophy). The cecotropes are then absorbed in the small intestine to utilize the nutrients.

Other animals
Gastric cecum of dissected
cockroach. Scale bar, 2 mm.
In contrast, obligate carnivores, whose diets contain little or no plant
matter, have a reduced cecum, which is often partially or wholly
replaced by the appendix.[15] Mammalian species which do not
develop a cecum include raccoons[17], bears[18], and the red
panda[19].
Many fish have a number of small outpockets, called pyloric ceca,
along their intestine; despite the name, they are not homologous
with the cecum of amniotes – their purpose is to increase the overall
area of the digestive epithelium.[15] Some invertebrates, such as
squid,[20] may also have structures with the same name, but these
have no relationship with those of vertebrates.
