Nutrient
A nutrient is a substance used by an organism to survive, grow, and reproduce. The
requirement for dietary nutrient intake applies to animals, plants, fungi, and protists. Nutrients can be
incorporated into cells for metabolic purposes or excreted by cells to create non-cellular structures, such as
hair, scales, feathers, or exoskeletons. Some nutrients can be metabolically converted to smaller molecules
in the process of releasing energy, such as for carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and fermentation products
(ethanol or vinegar), leading to end-products of water and carbon dioxide. All organisms require water.
Essential nutrients for animals are the energy sources, some of the amino acids that are combined to create
proteins, a subset of fatty acids, vitamins and certain minerals. Plants require more diverse minerals
absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed through leaves. Fungi live on dead or
living organic matter and meet nutrient needs from their host.
Different types of organisms have different essential nutrients. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is essential to
humans and some animal species, but most other animals and many plants are able to synthesize it.
Nutrients may be organic or inorganic: organic compounds include most compounds containing carbon,
while all other chemicals are inorganic. Inorganic nutrients include nutrients such as iron, selenium, and
zinc, while organic nutrients include, protein, fats, sugars, and vitamins.
A classification used primarily to describe nutrient needs of animals divides nutrients into macronutrients
and micronutrients. Consumed in relatively large amounts (grams or ounces), macronutrients
(carbohydrates, fats, proteins, water) are primarily used to generate energy or to incorporate into tissues for
growth and repair. Micronutrients are needed in smaller amounts (milligrams or micrograms); they have
subtle biochemical and physiological roles in cellular processes, like vascular functions or nerve conduction.
Inadequate amounts of essential nutrients, or diseases that interfere with absorption, result in a deficiency
state that compromises growth, survival and reproduction. Consumer advisories for dietary nutrient intakes,
such as the United States Dietary Reference Intake, are based on the amount required to prevent deficiency,
and provide macronutrient and micronutrient guides for both lower and upper limits of intake. In many
countries, regulations require that food product labels display information about the amount of any
macronutrients and micronutrients present in the food in significant quantities. Nutrients in larger quantities
than the body needs may have harmful effects.[1] Edible plants also contain thousands of compounds
generally called phytochemicals which have unknown effects on disease or health, including a diverse class
with non-nutrient status called polyphenols, which remain poorly understood as of 2017.
Macronutrients are defined in several ways.[2]
The chemical elements humans consume in the largest quantities are carbon, hydrogen,
nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulphur, summarized as CHNOPS.
Types
Macronutrients
The chemical compounds that humans consume in the largest quantities and provide bulk
energy are classified as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Water must be also consumed in
large quantities but does not provide caloric value.
Calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and chloride ions, along with phosphorus and
sulfur, are listed with macronutrients because they are required in large quantities compared
to micronutrients, i.e., vitamins and other minerals, the latter often described as trace or
ultratrace minerals.[3]
Macronutrients provide energy:
Carbohydrates are compounds made up of types of sugar. Carbohydrates are classified
according to their number of sugar units: monosaccharides (such as glucose and fructose),
disaccharides (such as sucrose and lactose), oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides (such
as starch, glycogen, and cellulose).
Proteins are organic compounds that consist of amino acids joined by peptide bonds. Since
the body cannot manufacture some of the amino acids (termed essential amino acids), the
diet must supply them. Through digestion, proteins are broken down by proteases back into
free amino acids.
Fats consist of a glycerin molecule with three fatty acids attached. Fatty acid molecules
contain a -COOH group attached to unbranched hydrocarbon chains connected by single
bonds alone (saturated fatty acids) or by both double and single bonds (unsaturated fatty
acids). Fats are needed for construction and maintenance of cell membranes, to maintain a
stable body temperature, and to sustain the health of skin and hair. Because the body does
not manufacture certain fatty acids (termed essential fatty acids), they must be obtained
through one's diet.
Ethanol is not an essential nutrient, but it does provide calories.The United States
Department of Agriculture uses a figure of 6.93 kilocalories (29.0 kJ) per gram of alcohol
(5.47 kcal or 22.9 kJ per ml) for calculating food energy.[4] For distilled spirits, a standard
serving in the U.S. is 44 ml (1.5 US fl oz), which at 40% ethanol (80 proof) would be 14
grams and 98 calories.

Micronutrients are essential dietary elements required in varying quantities throughout life to serve
metabolic and physiological functions.[6][7]
Dietary minerals, such as copper and iron, are elements native to Earth, and cannot be
synthesized. They are required in the diet in microgram or milligram amounts. As plants
obtain minerals from the soil, dietary minerals derive directly from plants consumed or
indirectly from edible animal sources.[8]
Micronutrients
Vitamins are organic compounds required in microgram or milligram amounts.[9] The
importance of each dietary vitamin was first established when it was determined that a
disease would develop if that vitamin was absent from the diet.[9]
An essential nutrient is a nutrient required for normal physiological function that cannot be synthesized in
the body – either at all or in sufficient quantities – and thus must be obtained from a dietary source.[10][11]
Apart from water, which is universally required for the maintenance of homeostasis in mammals,[12]
essential nutrients are indispensable for various cellular metabolic processes and for the maintenance and
function of tissues and organs.[13] The nutrients considered essential for humans comprise nine amino acids,
two fatty acids, thirteen vitamins, fifteen minerals and choline.[13] In addition, there are several molecules
that are considered conditionally essential nutrients since they are indispensable in certain developmental
and pathological states.[13][14][15]
An essential amino acid is an amino acid that is required by an organism but cannot be synthesized de novo
by it, and therefore must be supplied in its diet. Out of the twenty standard protein-producing amino acids,
nine cannot be endogenously synthesized by humans: phenylalanine, valine, threonine, tryptophan,
methionine, leucine, isoleucine, lysine, and histidine.[16][17]
Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are fatty acids that humans and other animals must ingest because the body
requires them for good health but cannot synthesize them.[18] Only two fatty acids are known to be
essential for humans: alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty
acid).[19]
Vitamins occur in a variety of related forms known as vitamers. The vitamers of a given vitamin perform the
functions of that vitamin and prevent symptoms of deficiency of that vitamin. Vitamins are those essential
organic molecules that are not classified as amino acids or fatty acids. They commonly function as
enzymatic cofactors, metabolic regulators or antioxidants. Humans require thirteen vitamins in their diet,
most of which are actually groups of related molecules (e.g. vitamin E includes tocopherols and
tocotrienols):[20] vitamins A, C, D, E, K, thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5),
pyridoxine (B6), biotin (B7), folate (B9), and cobalamin (B12). The requirement for vitamin D is
conditional, as people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial
source, synthesize vitamin D in the skin.[21]

Minerals
Minerals are the exogenous chemical elements indispensable for life. Although the four elements: carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen (CHON) are essential for life, they are so plentiful in food and drink that
these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for
nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino
acids. Sulfur is essential, but again does not have a recommended intake. Instead, recommended intakes are
identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine.
The essential nutrient trace elements for humans, listed in order of Recommended Dietary Allowance
(expressed as a mass), are potassium, chloride, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc,
manganese, copper, iodine, chromium, molybdenum, selenium. Additionally, cobalt is a component of
Vitamin B12 which is essential. There are other minerals which are essential for some plants and animals,
but may or may not be essential for humans, such as boron and silicon.
Choline is an essential nutrient.[22][23][24] The cholines are a family of water-soluble quaternary ammonium
compounds.[25][26] Choline is the parent compound of the cholines class, consisting of ethanolamine having
three methyl substituents attached to the amino function.[27] Healthy humans fed artificially composed diets
that are deficient in choline develop fatty liver, liver damage, and muscle damage. Choline was not initially
classified as essential because the human body can produce choline in small amounts through
phosphatidylcholine metabolism.[28]
Conditionally essential nutrients are certain organic molecules that can normally be synthesized by an
organism, but under certain conditions in insufficient quantities. In humans, such conditions include
premature birth, limited nutrient intake, rapid growth, and certain disease states.[14] Inositol, taurine,
arginine, glutamine and nucleotides are classified as conditionally essential and are particularly important in
neonatal diet and metabolism.[14]
Non-essential nutrients are substances within foods that can have a significant impact on health. Dietary
fiber is not absorbed in the human digestive tract.[29] Soluble fiber is metabolized to butyrate and other
short-chain fatty acids by bacteria residing in the large intestine.[30][31][32] Soluble fiber is marketed as
serving a prebiotic function with claims for promoting "healthy" intestinal bacteria.[33]
Ethanol (C2H5OH) is not an essential nutrient, but it does supply approximately 29 kilojoules (7
kilocalories) of food energy per gram.[34] For spirits (vodka, gin, rum, etc.) a standard serving in the United
States is 44 millilitres (11⁄2 US fluid ounces), which at 40% ethanol (80 proof) would be 14 grams and
410 kJ (98 kcal). At 50% alcohol, 17.5 g and 513 kJ (122.5 kcal). Wine and beer contain a similar amount
of ethanol in servings of 150 and 350  mL (5 and 12  US  fl  oz), respectively, but these beverages also
contribute to food energy intake from components other than ethanol. A 150 mL (5 US fl oz) serving of
wine contains 420 to 540 kJ (100 to 130 kcal). A 350 mL (12 US fl oz) serving of beer contains 400 to
840 kJ (95 to 200 kcal). According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, based on NHANES 2013–2014
Choline
Conditionally essential
Non-essential
Non-nutrients
surveys, women ages 20 and up consume on average 6.8 grams of alcohol per day and men consume on
average 15.5 grams per day.[35] Ignoring the non-alcohol contribution of those beverages, the average
ethanol contributions to daily food energy intake are 200 and 450  kJ (48 and 108  kcal), respectively.
Alcoholic beverages are considered empty calorie foods because, while providing energy, they contribute
no essential nutrients.[34]
By definition, phytochemicals include all nutritional and non-nutritional components of edible plants.[36]
Included as nutritional constituents are provitamin A carotenoids,[37] whereas those without nutrient status
are diverse polyphenols, flavonoids, resveratrol, and lignans that are present in numerous plant foods.[38]
Some phytochemical compounds are under preliminary research for their potential effects on human
diseases and health.[36][37][38] However, the qualification for nutrient status of compounds with poorly
defined properties in vivo is that they must first be defined with a Dietary Reference Intake level to enable
accurate food labeling,[39] a condition not established for most phytochemicals that are claimed to be
antioxidant nutrients.[40]
See Vitamin, Mineral (nutrient), Protein (nutrient)
An inadequate amount of a nutrient is a deficiency. Deficiencies can be due to a number of causes including
an inadequacy in nutrient intake, called a dietary deficiency, or any of several conditions that interfere with
the utilization of a nutrient within an organism.[1] Some of the conditions that can interfere with nutrient
utilization include problems with nutrient absorption, substances that cause a greater than normal need for a
nutrient, conditions that cause nutrient destruction, and conditions that cause greater nutrient excretion.[1]
Nutrient toxicity occurs when excess consumption of a nutrient does harm to an organism.[41]
In the United States and Canada, recommended dietary intake levels of essential nutrients are based on the
minimum level that "will maintain a defined level of nutriture in an individual", a definition somewhat
different from that used by the World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization of a
"basal requirement to indicate the level of intake needed to prevent pathologically relevant and clinically
detectable signs of a dietary inadequacy".[42]
In setting human nutrient guidelines, government organizations do not necessarily agree on amounts needed
to avoid deficiency or maximum amounts to avoid the risk of toxicity.[43][44][45] For example, for vitamin
C, recommended intakes range from 40 mg/day in India[46] to 155 mg/day for the European Union.[47] The
table below shows U.S. Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances
(RDAs) for vitamins and minerals, PRIs for the European Union (same concept as RDAs), followed by
what three government organizations deem to be the safe upper intake. RDAs are set higher than EARs to
cover people with higher than average needs. Adequate Intakes (AIs) are set when there is not sufficient
information to establish EARs and RDAs. Countries establish tolerable upper intake levels, also referred to
as upper limits (ULs), based on amounts that cause adverse effects. Governments are slow to revise
information of this nature. For the U.S. values, with the exception of calcium and vitamin D, all of the data
date from 1997 to 2004.[17]

* The daily recommended amounts of niacin and magnesium are higher than the tolerable upper limit
because, for both nutrients, the ULs identify the amounts which will not increase risk of adverse effects
when the nutrients are consumed as a serving of a dietary supplement. Magnesium supplementation above
the UL may cause diarrhea. Supplementation with niacin above the UL may cause flushing of the face and
a sensation of body warmth. Each country or regional regulatory agency decides on a safety margin below
when symptoms may occur, so the ULs may differ based on source.[43][44]
EAR U.S. Estimated Average Requirements.
RDA U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowances; higher for adults than for children, and may be even higher

PRI Population Reference Intake is European Union equivalent of RDA; higher for adults than for
children, and may be even higher for women who are pregnant or lactating. For Thiamin and Niacin, the
PRIs are expressed as amounts per megajoule (239 kilocalories) of food energy consumed.

ND ULs have not been determined.
NE EARs, PRIs or AIs have not yet been established or will not be (EU does not consider chromium an

Plant nutrients consist of more than a dozen minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and
oxygen absorbed or released through leaves. All organisms obtain all their nutrients from the surrounding
environment.[48][49]
Plants absorb carbon, hydrogen and oxygen from air and soil in the form of carbon dioxide and water.[50]
Other nutrients are absorbed from soil (exceptions include some parasitic or carnivorous plants). Counting
these, there are 17 important nutrients for plants:[51] these are macronutrients; nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),
potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), magnesium (Mg), carbon (C), oxygen(O) and hydrogen (H), and
the micronutrients; iron (Fe), boron (B), chlorine (Cl), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu),
molybdenum (Mo) and nickel (Ni). In addition to carbon, hydrogen and oxygen; nitrogen, phosphorus, and
sulfur are also needed in relatively large quantities. Together, the "Big Six" are the elemental
macronutrients for all organisms.[52] They are sourced from inorganic matter (for example, carbon
dioxide, water, nitrates, phosphates, sulfates, and diatomic molecules of nitrogen and, especially, oxygen)
and organic matter (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins).
