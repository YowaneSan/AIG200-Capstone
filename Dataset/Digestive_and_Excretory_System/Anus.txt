Anus
In mammals, invertebrates and most fish,[1][2] the anus (pl.:
anuses or ani; from Latin, 'ring' or 'circle') is the external body
orifice at the exit end of the digestive tract (bowel), i.e. the
opposite end from the mouth. Its function is to facilitate the
expulsion of wastes that remain after digestion.
Bowel contents that pass through the anus include the gaseous
flatus and the semi-solid feces, which (depending on the type of
animal) include: indigestible matter such as bones, hair pellets,
endozoochorous seeds and digestive rocks;[3] residual food
material after the digestible nutrients have been extracted, for
example cellulose or lignin; ingested matter which would be
toxic if it remained in the digestive tract; excreted metabolites
like bilirubin-containing bile; and dead mucosal epithelia or
excess gut bacteria and other endosymbionts. Passage of feces
through the anus is typically controlled by muscular sphincters,
and failure to stop unwanted passages results in fecal
incontinence.
Amphibians, reptiles and birds use a similar orifice (known as
the cloaca) for excreting liquid and solid wastes, for copulation
and egg-laying. Monotreme mammals also have a cloaca,
which is thought to be a feature inherited from the earliest
amniotes. Marsupials have a single orifice for excreting both
solids and liquids and, in females, a separate vagina for
reproduction. Female placental mammals have completely
separate orifices for defecation, urination, and reproduction;
males have one opening for defecation and another for both
urination and reproduction, although the channels flowing to
that orifice are almost completely separate.
The development of the anus was an important stage in the
evolution of multicellular animals. It appears to have happened
at least twice, following different paths in protostomes and
deuterostomes. This accompanied or facilitated other important
evolutionary developments: the bilaterian body plan, the
coelom, and metamerism, in which the body was built of
repeated "modules" which could later specialize, such as the
heads of most arthropods, which are composed of fused,
specialized segments.

Anatomical terminology
In comb jellies, there are species with one and sometimes two
permanent anuses, species like the warty comb jelly grows an
anus, which then disappear when it is no longer needed.[4]
In animals at least as complex as an earthworm, the embryo
forms a dent on one side, the blastopore, which deepens to become the archenteron, the first phase in the
growth of the gut. In deuterostomes, the original dent becomes the anus while the gut eventually tunnels
through to make another opening, which forms the mouth. The protostomes were so named because it was
thought that in their embryos the dent formed the mouth first (proto– meaning "first") and the anus was
formed later at the opening made by the other end of the gut. Research from 2001 shows the edges of the
dent close up in the middles of protosomes, leaving openings at the ends which become the mouths and
anuses.[5]
