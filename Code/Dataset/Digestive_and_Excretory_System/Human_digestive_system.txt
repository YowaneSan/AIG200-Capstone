Human digestive system
The human digestive system consists of the gastrointestinal
tract plus the accessory organs of digestion (the tongue, salivary
glands, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder). Digestion involves the
breakdown of food into smaller and smaller components, until
they can be absorbed and assimilated into the body. The
process of digestion has three stages: the cephalic phase, the
gastric phase, and the intestinal phase.
The first stage, the cephalic phase of digestion, begins with
secretions from gastric glands in response to the sight and smell
of food. This stage includes the mechanical breakdown of food
by chewing, and the chemical breakdown by digestive
enzymes, that takes place in the mouth. Saliva contains the
digestive enzymes amylase, and lingual lipase, secreted by the
salivary and serous glands on the tongue. Chewing, in which
the food is mixed with saliva, begins the mechanical process of
digestion. This produces a bolus which is swallowed down the
esophagus to enter the stomach.
The second stage, the gastric phase, happens in the stomach.
Here, the food is further broken down by mixing with gastric
acid until it passes into the duodenum, the first part of the small
intestine.
The third stage, the intestinal phase, begins in the duodenum.
Here, the partially digested food is mixed with a number of
enzymes produced by the pancreas.
Digestion is helped by the chewing of food carried out by the
muscles of mastication, the tongue, and the teeth, and also by
the contractions of peristalsis, and segmentation. Gastric acid,
and the production of mucus in the stomach, are essential for
the continuation of digestion.
Peristalsis is the rhythmic contraction of muscles that begins in
the esophagus and continues along the wall of the stomach and
the rest of the gastrointestinal tract. This initially results in the
production of chyme which when fully broken down in the
small intestine is absorbed as chyle into the lymphatic system.
Most of the digestion of food takes place in the small intestine.

digestive system
Water and some minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in
the colon of the large intestine. The waste products of digestion
(feces) are defecated from the rectum via the anus.
There are several organs and other components involved in the digestion
of food. The organs known as the accessory digestive organs are the
liver, gall bladder and pancreas. Other components include the mouth,
salivary glands, tongue, teeth and epiglottis.
The largest structure of the digestive system is the gastrointestinal tract (GI
tract). This starts at the mouth and ends at the anus, covering a distance of
about nine metres.[1]
A major digestive organ is the stomach. Within its mucosa are millions of
embedded gastric glands. Their secretions are vital to the functioning of
the organ.
Most of the digestion of food takes place in the small intestine which is the
longest part of the GI tract.
The largest part of the GI tract is the colon or large intestine. Water is absorbed here and the remaining
waste matter is stored prior to defecation.[2]
There are many specialised cells of the GI tract. These include the various cells of the gastric glands, taste
cells, pancreatic duct cells, enterocytes and microfold cells.
Some parts of the digestive system are also part of the excretory system, including the large intestine.[2]
The mouth is the first part of the upper gastrointestinal tract
and is equipped with several structures that begin the first
processes of digestion.[3] These include salivary glands, teeth
and the tongue. The mouth consists of two regions; the
vestibule and the oral cavity proper. The vestibule is the area
between the teeth, lips and cheeks,[4] and the rest is the oral
cavity proper. Most of the oral cavity is lined with oral
mucosa, a mucous membrane that produces a lubricating
mucus, of which only a small amount is needed. Mucous
membranes vary in structure in the different regions of the
body but they all produce a lubricating mucus, which is either
secreted by surface cells or more usually by underlying glands. The mucous membrane in the mouth
continues as the thin mucosa which lines the bases of the teeth. The main component of mucus is a
glycoprotein called mucin and the type secreted varies according to the region involved. Mucin is viscous,

clear, and clinging. Underlying the mucous membrane in the mouth is a thin layer of smooth muscle tissue
and the loose connection to the membrane gives it its great elasticity.[5] It covers the cheeks, inner surfaces
of the lips, and floor of the mouth, and the mucin produced is highly protective against tooth decay.[6]
The roof of the mouth is termed the palate and it separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity. The palate is
hard at the front of the mouth since the overlying mucosa is covering a plate of bone; it is softer and more
pliable at the back being made of muscle and connective tissue, and it can move to swallow food and
liquids. The soft palate ends at the uvula.[7] The surface of the hard palate allows for the pressure needed in
eating food, to leave the nasal passage clear.[8] The opening between the lips is termed the oral fissure, and
the opening into the throat is called the fauces.[9]
At either side of the soft palate are the palatoglossus muscles which also reach into regions of the tongue.
These muscles raise the back of the tongue and also close both sides of the fauces to enable food to be
swallowed.[10]: 
1208  Mucus helps in the mastication of food in its ability to soften and collect the food in the
formation of the bolus.
There are three pairs of main salivary glands and between 800 and 1,000
minor salivary glands, all of which mainly serve the digestive process, and
also play an important role in the maintenance of dental health and general
mouth lubrication, without which speech would be impossible.[11] The
main glands are all exocrine glands, secreting via ducts. All of these
glands terminate in the mouth. The largest of these are the parotid glands
—their secretion is mainly serous. The next pair are underneath the jaw,
the submandibular glands, these produce both serous fluid and mucus.
The serous fluid is produced by serous glands in these salivary glands
which also produce lingual lipase. They produce about 70% of the oral
cavity saliva. The third pair are the sublingual glands located underneath
the tongue and their secretion is mainly mucous with a small percentage of
saliva.
Within the oral mucosa, and also on the tongue, palates, and floor of the mouth, are the minor salivary
glands; their secretions are mainly mucous and they are innervated by the facial nerve (CN7).[12] The
glands also secrete amylase a first stage in the breakdown of food acting on the carbohydrate in the food to
transform the starch content into maltose. There are other serous glands on the surface of the tongue that
encircle taste buds on the back part of the tongue and these also produce lingual lipase. Lipase is a digestive
enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of lipids (fats). These glands are termed Von Ebner's glands which
have also been shown to have another function in the secretion of histatins which offer an early defense
(outside of the immune system) against microbes in food, when it makes contact with these glands on the
tongue tissue.[11][13] Sensory information can stimulate the secretion of saliva providing the necessary fluid
for the tongue to work with and also to ease swallowing of the food.
Salivary glands
Saliva
Saliva moistens and softens food, and along with the chewing action of the teeth, transforms the food into a
smooth bolus. The bolus is further helped by the lubrication provided by the saliva in its passage from the
mouth into the esophagus. Also of importance is the presence in saliva of the digestive enzymes amylase
and lipase. Amylase starts to work on the starch in carbohydrates, breaking it down into the simple sugars of
maltose and dextrose that can be further broken down in the small intestine. Saliva in the mouth can account
for 30% of this initial starch digestion. Lipase starts to work on breaking down fats. Lipase is further
produced in the pancreas where it is released to continue this digestion of fats. The presence of salivary
lipase is of prime importance in young babies whose pancreatic lipase has yet to be developed.[14]
As well as its role in supplying digestive enzymes, saliva has a cleansing action for the teeth and mouth.[15]
It also has an immunological role in supplying antibodies to the system, such as immunoglobulin A.[16] This
is seen to be key in preventing infections of the salivary glands, importantly that of parotitis.
Saliva also contains a glycoprotein called haptocorrin which is a binding protein to vitamin B12.[17] It binds
with the vitamin in order to carry it safely through the acidic content of the stomach. When it reaches the
duodenum, pancreatic enzymes break down the glycoprotein and free the vitamin which then binds with
intrinsic factor.
Food enters the mouth where the first stage in the digestive
process takes place, with the action of the tongue and the
secretion of saliva. The tongue is a fleshy and muscular sensory
organ, and the first sensory information is received via the taste
buds in the papillae on its surface. If the taste is agreeable, the
tongue will go into action, manipulating the food in the mouth
which stimulates the secretion of saliva from the salivary glands.
The liquid quality of the saliva will help in the softening of the
food and its enzyme content will start to break down the food
whilst it is still in the mouth. The first part of the food to be
broken down is the starch of carbohydrates (by the enzyme
amylase in the saliva).
The tongue is attached to the floor of the mouth by a
ligamentous band called the frenum[5] and this gives it great mobility for the manipulation of food (and
speech); the range of manipulation is optimally controlled by the action of several muscles and limited in its
external range by the stretch of the frenum. The tongue's two sets of muscles, are four intrinsic muscles that
originate in the tongue and are involved with its shaping, and four extrinsic muscles originating in bone that
are involved with its movement.
Taste is a form of chemoreception that takes place in the specialised taste receptors, contained in structures
called taste buds in the mouth. Taste buds are mainly on the upper surface (dorsum) of the tongue. The
function of taste perception is vital to help prevent harmful or rotten foods from being consumed. There are
also taste buds on the epiglottis and upper part of the esophagus. The taste buds are innervated by a branch
of the facial nerve the chorda tympani, and the glossopharyngeal nerve. Taste messages are sent via these
cranial nerves to the brain. The brain can distinguish between the chemical qualities of the food. The five

basic tastes are referred to as those of saltiness, sourness, bitterness,
sweetness, and umami. The detection of saltiness and sourness
enables the control of salt and acid balance. The detection of
bitterness warns of poisons—many of a plant's defences are of
poisonous compounds that are bitter. Sweetness guides to those
foods that will supply energy; the initial breakdown of the energy-
giving carbohydrates by salivary amylase creates the taste of
sweetness since simple sugars are the first result. The taste of
umami is thought to signal protein-rich food. Sour tastes are acidic
which is often found in bad food. The brain has to decide very
quickly whether the food should be eaten or not. It was the findings in 1991, describing the first olfactory
receptors that helped to prompt the research into taste. The olfactory receptors are located on cell surfaces in
the nose which bind to chemicals enabling the detection of smells. It is assumed that signals from taste
receptors work together with those from the nose, to form an idea of complex food flavours.[18]
Teeth are complex structures made of materials specific to them. They are made of a bone-like material
called dentin, which is covered by the hardest tissue in the body—enamel.[8] Teeth have different shapes to
deal with different aspects of mastication employed in tearing and chewing pieces of food into smaller and
smaller pieces. This results in a much larger surface area for the action of digestive enzymes. The teeth are
named after their particular roles in the process of mastication—incisors are used for cutting or biting off
pieces of food; canines, are used for tearing, premolars and molars are used for chewing and grinding.
Mastication of the food with the help of saliva and mucus results in the formation of a soft bolus which can
then be swallowed to make its way down the upper gastrointestinal tract to the stomach.[19] The digestive
enzymes in saliva also help in keeping the teeth clean by breaking down any lodged food particles.[20][15]
The epiglottis is a flap of elastic cartilage attached to the entrance of the
larynx. It is covered with a mucous membrane and there are taste buds
on its lingual surface which faces into the mouth.[21] Its laryngeal
surface faces into the larynx. The epiglottis functions to guard the
entrance of the glottis, the opening between the vocal folds. It is
normally pointed upward during breathing with its underside
functioning as part of the pharynx, but during swallowing, the
epiglottis folds down to a more horizontal position, with its upper side
functioning as part of the pharynx. In this manner it prevents food from
going into the trachea and instead directs it to the esophagus, which is
behind. During swallowing, the backward motion of the tongue forces
the epiglottis over the glottis' opening to prevent any food that is being
swallowed from entering the larynx which leads to the lungs; the

larynx is also pulled upwards to assist this process. Stimulation of the larynx by ingested matter produces a
strong cough reflex in order to protect the lungs.
The pharynx is a part of the conducting zone of the respiratory system and also a part of the digestive
system. It is the part of the throat immediately behind the nasal cavity at the back of the mouth and above
the esophagus and larynx. The pharynx is made up of three parts. The lower two parts—the oropharynx
and the laryngopharynx are involved in the digestive system. The laryngopharynx connects to the
esophagus and it serves as a passageway for both air and food. Air enters the larynx anteriorly but anything
swallowed has priority and the passage of air is temporarily blocked. The pharynx is innervated by the
pharyngeal plexus of the vagus nerve.[10]: 
1465  Muscles in the pharynx push the food into the esophagus.
The pharynx joins the esophagus at the oesophageal inlet which is located behind the cricoid cartilage.
The esophagus, commonly known as the foodpipe or gullet,
consists of a muscular tube through which food passes from the
pharynx to the stomach. The esophagus is continuous with the
laryngopharynx. It passes through the posterior mediastinum in the
thorax and enters the stomach through a hole in the thoracic
diaphragm—the esophageal hiatus, at the level of the tenth thoracic
vertebra (T10). Its length averages 25  cm, varying with an
individual's height. It is divided into cervical, thoracic and
abdominal parts. The pharynx joins the esophagus at the esophageal
inlet which is behind the cricoid cartilage.
At rest the esophagus is closed at both ends, by the upper and lower
esophageal sphincters. The opening of the upper sphincter is triggered by the swallowing reflex so that food
is allowed through. The sphincter also serves to prevent back flow from the esophagus into the pharynx.
The esophagus has a mucous membrane and the epithelium which has a protective function is continuously
replaced due to the volume of food that passes inside the esophagus. During swallowing, food passes from
the mouth through the pharynx into the esophagus. The epiglottis folds down to a more horizontal position
to direct the food into the esophagus, and away from the trachea.
Once in the esophagus, the bolus travels down to the stomach via rhythmic contraction and relaxation of
muscles known as peristalsis. The lower esophageal sphincter is a muscular sphincter surrounding the lower
part of the esophagus. The gastroesophageal junction between the esophagus and the stomach is controlled
by the lower esophageal sphincter, which remains constricted at all times other than during swallowing and
vomiting to prevent the contents of the stomach from entering the esophagus. As the esophagus does not
have the same protection from acid as the stomach, any failure of this sphincter can lead to heartburn.
The diaphragm is an important part of the body's digestive system. The muscular diaphragm separates the
thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity where most of the digestive organs are located. The suspensory
muscle attaches the ascending duodenum to the diaphragm. This muscle is thought to be of help in the
Pharynx

digestive system in that its attachment offers a wider angle to the duodenojejunal flexure for the easier
passage of digesting material. The diaphragm also attaches to, and anchors the liver at its bare area. The
esophagus enters the abdomen through a hole in the diaphragm at the level of T10.
The stomach is a major organ of the gastrointestinal tract and digestive
system. It is a consistently J-shaped organ joined to the esophagus at its
upper end and to the duodenum at its lower end. Gastric acid
(informally gastric juice), produced in the stomach plays a vital role in
the digestive process, and mainly contains hydrochloric acid and
sodium chloride. A peptide hormone, gastrin, produced by G cells in
the gastric glands, stimulates the production of gastric juice which
activates the digestive enzymes. Pepsinogen is a precursor enzyme
(zymogen) produced by the gastric chief cells, and gastric acid
activates this to the enzyme pepsin which begins the digestion of
proteins. As these two chemicals would damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by innumerable gastric
glands in the stomach, to provide a slimy protective layer against the damaging effects of the chemicals on
the inner layers of the stomach.
At the same time that protein is being digested, mechanical churning occurs through the action of peristalsis,
waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further
mix with the digestive enzymes. Gastric lipase secreted by the chief cells in the fundic glands in the gastric
mucosa of the stomach, is an acidic lipase, in contrast with the alkaline pancreatic lipase. This breaks down
fats to some degree though is not as efficient as the pancreatic lipase.
The pylorus, the lowest section of the stomach which attaches to the duodenum via the pyloric canal,
contains countless glands which secrete digestive enzymes including gastrin. After an hour or two, a thick
semi-liquid called chyme is produced. When the pyloric sphincter, or valve opens, chyme enters the
duodenum where it mixes further with digestive enzymes from the pancreas, and then passes through the
small intestine, where digestion continues.
The parietal cells in the fundus of the stomach, produce a glycoprotein called intrinsic factor which is
essential for the absorption of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin), is carried to, and through the
stomach, bound to a glycoprotein secreted by the salivary glands – transcobalamin I also called haptocorrin,
which protects the acid-sensitive vitamin from the acidic stomach contents. Once in the more neutral
duodenum, pancreatic enzymes break down the protective glycoprotein. The freed vitamin B12 then binds
to intrinsic factor which is then absorbed by the enterocytes in the ileum.
The stomach is a distensible organ and can normally expand to hold about one litre of food.[22] This
expansion is enabled by a series of gastric folds in the inner walls of the stomach. The stomach of a
newborn baby will only be able to expand to retain about 30 ml.
The spleen is the largest lymphoid organ in the body but has other functions.[23] It breaks down both red
and white blood cells that are spent. This is why it is sometimes known as the 'graveyard of red blood
cells'.[23] A product of this digestion is the pigment bilirubin, which is sent to the liver and secreted in the
Stomach

bile. Another product is iron, which is used in the formation of new blood cells in the bone marrow.[5]
Medicine treats the spleen solely as belonging to the lymphatic system, though it is acknowledged that the
full range of its important functions is not yet understood.[10]: 
1751 
The liver is the second largest organ (after the skin)
and is an accessory digestive gland which plays a
role in the body's metabolism. The liver has many
functions some of which are important to digestion.
The liver can detoxify various metabolites;
synthesise proteins and produce biochemicals
needed for digestion. It regulates the storage of
glycogen which it can form from glucose
(glycogenesis). The liver can also synthesise
glucose from certain amino acids. Its digestive
functions are largely involved with the breaking
down of carbohydrates. It also maintains protein
metabolism in its synthesis and degradation. In lipid
metabolism it synthesises cholesterol. Fats are also
produced in the process of lipogenesis. The liver synthesises the bulk of lipoproteins. The liver is located in
the upper right quadrant of the abdomen and below the diaphragm to which it is attached at one part, the
bare area of the liver. This is to the right of the stomach and it overlies the gall bladder. The liver synthesises
bile acids and lecithin to promote the digestion of fat.[24]
Bile produced by the liver is made up of water (97%), bile salts, mucus and pigments, 1% fats and inorganic
salts.[25] Bilirubin is its major pigment. Bile acts partly as a surfactant which lowers the surface tension
between either two liquids or a solid and a liquid and helps to emulsify the fats in the chyme. Food fat is
dispersed by the action of bile into smaller units called micelles. The breaking down into micelles creates a
much larger surface area for the pancreatic enzyme, lipase to work on. Lipase digests the triglycerides
which are broken down into two fatty acids and a monoglyceride. These are then absorbed by villi on the
intestinal wall. If fats are not absorbed in this way in the small intestine problems can arise later in the large
intestine which is not equipped to absorb fats. Bile also helps in the absorption of vitamin K from the diet.
Bile is collected and delivered through the common hepatic duct. This duct joins with the cystic duct to
connect in a common bile duct with the gallbladder. Bile is stored in the gallbladder for release when food is
discharged into the duodenum and also after a few hours.[5]
The gallbladder is a hollow part of the biliary tract that sits just beneath the liver, with the gallbladder body
resting in a small depression.[26] It is a small organ where the bile produced by the liver is stored, before
being released into the small intestine. Bile flows from the liver through the bile ducts and into the gall
bladder for storage. The bile is released in response to cholecystokinin (CCK), a peptide hormone released
from the duodenum. The production of CCK (by endocrine cells of the duodenum) is stimulated by the
presence of fat in the duodenum.[27]

Action of digestive hormones
It is divided into three sections, a fundus, body and neck. The neck
tapers and connects to the biliary tract via the cystic duct, which then
joins the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct. At this
junction is a mucosal fold called Hartmann's pouch, where gallstones
commonly get stuck. The muscular layer of the body is of smooth
muscle tissue that helps the gallbladder contract, so that it can
discharge its bile into the bile duct. The gallbladder needs to store bile
in a natural, semi-liquid form at all times. Hydrogen ions secreted from
the inner lining of the gallbladder keep the bile acidic enough to
prevent hardening. To dilute the bile, water and electrolytes from the
digestion system are added. Also, salts attach themselves to cholesterol
molecules in the bile to keep them from crystallising. If there is too much cholesterol or bilirubin in the bile,
or if the gallbladder does not empty properly the systems can fail. This is how gallstones form when a small
piece of calcium gets coated with either cholesterol or bilirubin and the bile crystallises and forms a
gallstone. The main purpose of the gallbladder is to store and release bile, or gall. Bile is released into the
small intestine in order to help in the digestion of fats by breaking down larger molecules into smaller ones.
After the fat is absorbed, the bile is also absorbed and transported back to the liver for reuse.
The pancreas is a major organ functioning as an accessory
digestive gland in the digestive system. It is both an endocrine
gland and an exocrine gland.[28] The endocrine part secretes
insulin when the blood sugar becomes high; insulin moves
glucose from the blood into the muscles and other tissues for use
as energy. The endocrine part releases glucagon when the blood
sugar is low; glucagon allows stored sugar to be broken down
into glucose by the liver in order to re-balance the sugar levels.
The pancreas produces and releases important digestive enzymes
in the pancreatic juice that it delivers to the duodenum.[24] The
pancreas lies below and at the back of the stomach. It connects
to the duodenum via the pancreatic duct which it joins near to the bile
duct's connection where both the bile and pancreatic juice can act on
the chyme that is released from the stomach into the duodenum.
Aqueous pancreatic secretions from pancreatic duct cells contain
bicarbonate ions which are alkaline and help with the bile to neutralise
the acidic chyme that is churned out by the stomach.
The pancreas is also the main source of enzymes for the digestion of
fats and proteins. Some of these are released in response to the
production of cholecystokinin in the duodenum. (The enzymes that
digest polysaccharides, by contrast, are primarily produced by the walls of the intestines.) The cells are
filled with secretory granules containing the precursor digestive enzymes. The major proteases, the
pancreatic enzymes which work on proteins, are trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. Elastase is also
produced. Smaller amounts of lipase and amylase are secreted. The pancreas also secretes phospholipase
A2, lysophospholipase, and cholesterol esterase. The precursor zymogens, are inactive variants of the
Pancreas

enzymes; which avoids the onset of pancreatitis caused by autodegradation. Once released in the intestine,
the enzyme enteropeptidase present in the intestinal mucosa activates trypsinogen by cleaving it to form
trypsin; further cleavage results in chymotripsin.
The lower gastrointestinal tract (GI), includes the small intestine and all of the large intestine.[29] The
intestine is also called the bowel or the gut. The lower GI starts at the pyloric sphincter of the stomach and
finishes at the anus. The small intestine is subdivided into the duodenum, the jejunum and the ileum. The
cecum marks the division between the small and large intestine. The large intestine includes the rectum and
anal canal.[2]
Partially digested food starts to arrive in the small intestine as semi-
liquid chyme, one hour after it is eaten. The stomach is half empty
after an average of 1.2 hours.[30] After four or five hours the
stomach has emptied.[31]
In the small intestine, the pH becomes crucial; it needs to be finely
balanced in order to activate digestive enzymes. The chyme is very
acidic, with a low pH, having been released from the stomach and
needs to be made much more alkaline. This is achieved in the
duodenum by the addition of bile from the gall bladder combined
with the bicarbonate secretions from the pancreatic duct and also
from secretions of bicarbonate-rich mucus from duodenal glands
known as Brunner's glands. The chyme arrives in the intestines
having been released from the stomach through the opening of the
pyloric sphincter. The resulting alkaline fluid mix neutralises the gastric acid which would damage the
lining of the intestine. The mucus component lubricates the walls of the intestine.
When the digested food particles are reduced
enough in size and composition, they can be
absorbed by the intestinal wall and carried to
the bloodstream. The first receptacle for this
chyme is the duodenal bulb. From here it
passes into the first of the three sections of the
small intestine, the duodenum (the next section
is the jejunum and the third is the ileum). The
duodenum is the first and shortest section of
the small intestine. It is a hollow, jointed C-
shaped tube connecting the stomach to the
jejunum. It starts at the duodenal bulb and ends
at the suspensory muscle of duodenum. The attachment of the suspensory muscle to the diaphragm is
thought to help the passage of food by making a wider angle at its attachment.
Lower gastrointestinal tract
Small intestine
Cecum and beginning of ascending
colon
Most food digestion takes place in the small intestine. Segmentation contractions act to mix and move the
chyme more slowly in the small intestine allowing more time for absorption (and these continue in the large
intestine). In the duodenum, pancreatic lipase is secreted together with a co-enzyme, colipase to further
digest the fat content of the chyme. From this breakdown, smaller particles of emulsified fats called
chylomicrons are produced. There are also digestive cells called enterocytes lining the intestines (the
majority being in the small intestine). They are unusual cells in that they have villi on their surface which in
turn have innumerable microvilli on their surface. All these villi make for a greater surface area, not only for
the absorption of chyme but also for its further digestion by large numbers of digestive enzymes present on
the microvilli.
The chylomicrons are small enough to pass through the enterocyte villi and into their lymph capillaries
called lacteals. A milky fluid called chyle, consisting mainly of the emulsified fats of the chylomicrons,
results from the absorbed mix with the lymph in the lacteals. Chyle is then transported through the
lymphatic system to the rest of the body.
The suspensory muscle marks the end of the duodenum and the division between the upper gastrointestinal
tract and the lower GI tract. The digestive tract continues as the jejunum which continues as the ileum. The
jejunum, the midsection of the small intestine contains circular folds, flaps of doubled mucosal membrane
which partially encircle and sometimes completely encircle the lumen of the intestine. These folds together
with villi serve to increase the surface area of the jejunum enabling an increased absorption of digested
sugars, amino acids and fatty acids into the bloodstream. The circular folds also slow the passage of food
giving more time for nutrients to be absorbed.
The last part of the small intestine is the ileum. This also contains villi and vitamin B12; bile acids and any
residue nutrients are absorbed here. When the chyme is exhausted of its nutrients the remaining waste
material changes into the semi-solids called feces, which pass to the large intestine, where bacteria in the gut
flora further break down residual proteins and starches.[32]
Transit time through the small intestine is an average of 4 hours. Half of the food residues of a meal have
emptied from the small intestine by an average of 5.4 hours after ingestion. Emptying of the small intestine
is complete after an average of 8.6 hours.[30]
The cecum is a pouch marking the division between the small
intestine and the large intestine. It lies below the ileocecal valve in
the lower right quadrant of the abdomen.[33] The cecum receives
chyme from the last part of the small intestine, the ileum, and
connects to the ascending colon of the large intestine. At this
junction there is a sphincter or valve, the ileocecal valve which
slows the passage of chyme from the ileum, allowing further
digestion. It is also the site of the appendix attachment.[33]
In the large intestine,[2] the passage of the digesting food in the colon is a lot slower, taking from 30 to 40
hours until it is removed by defecation.[31] The colon mainly serves as a site for the fermentation of
digestible matter by the gut flora. The time taken varies considerably between individuals. The remaining

semi-solid waste is termed feces and is removed by the coordinated
contractions of the intestinal walls, termed peristalsis, which propels
the excreta forward to reach the rectum and exit through the anus via
defecation. The wall has an outer layer of longitudinal muscles, the
taeniae coli, and an inner layer of circular muscles. The circular muscle
keeps the material moving forward and also prevents any back flow of
waste. Also of help in the action of peristalsis is the basal electrical
rhythm that determines the frequency of contractions.[34] The taeniae
coli can be seen and are responsible for the bulges (haustra) present in
the colon. Most parts of the GI tract are covered with serous
membranes and have a mesentery. Other more muscular parts are lined
with adventitia.
The digestive system is supplied by the celiac artery. The celiac artery
is the first major branch from the abdominal aorta, and is the only
major artery that nourishes the digestive organs.
There are three main divisions – the left gastric artery, the common
hepatic artery and the splenic artery.
The celiac artery supplies the liver, stomach, spleen and the upper 1/3
of the duodenum (to the sphincter of Oddi) and the pancreas with
oxygenated blood. Most of the blood is returned to the liver via the
portal venous system for further processing and detoxification before
returning to the systemic circulation via the hepatic veins.
The next branch from the abdominal aorta is the superior mesenteric artery,
which supplies the regions of the digestive tract derived from the midgut,
which includes the distal 2/3 of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum,
appendix, ascending colon, and the proximal 2/3 of the transverse colon.
The final branch which is important for the digestive system is the inferior
mesenteric artery, which supplies the regions of the digestive tract derived
from the hindgut, which includes the distal 1/3 of the transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon,
rectum, and the anus above the pectinate line.
Blood flow to the digestive tract reaches its maximum 20–40 minutes after a meal and lasts for 1.5–2
hours.[35]
The enteric nervous system consists of some one hundred million neurons[36] that are embedded in the
peritoneum, the lining of the gastrointestinal tract extending from the esophagus to the anus.[37] These
neurons are collected into two plexuses – the myenteric (or Auerbach's) plexus that lies between the
longitudinal and the smooth muscle layers, and the submucosal (or Meissner's) plexus that lies between the
circular smooth muscle layer and the mucosa.[38][39][40]
Blood supply
Nerve supply
Parasympathetic innervation to the ascending colon is supplied by the vagus nerve. Sympathetic innervation
is supplied by the splanchnic nerves that join the celiac ganglia. Most of the digestive tract is innervated by
the two large celiac ganglia, with the upper part of each ganglion joined by the greater splanchnic nerve and
the lower parts joined by the lesser splanchnic nerve. It is from these ganglia that many of the gastric
plexuses arise.
Early in embryonic development, the embryo has three germ layers and abuts a yolk sac. During the second
week of development, the embryo grows and begins to surround and envelop portions of this sac. The
enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract. Sections of this foregut begin to
differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the esophagus, stomach, and intestines.[41]
During the fourth week of development, the stomach rotates. The stomach, originally lying in the midline of
the embryo, rotates so that its body is on the left. This rotation also affects the part of the gastrointestinal
tube immediately below the stomach, which will go on to become the duodenum. By the end of the fourth
week, the developing duodenum begins to spout a small outpouching on its right side, the hepatic
diverticulum, which will go on to become the biliary tree. Just below this is a second outpouching, known
as the cystic diverticulum, that will eventually develop into the gallbladder.[41]
Each part of the digestive system is subject to a wide range of disorders many of which can be congenital.
Mouth diseases can also be caused by pathogenic bacteria, viruses, fungi and as a side effect of some
medications. Mouth diseases include tongue diseases and salivary gland diseases. A common gum disease
in the mouth is gingivitis which is caused by bacteria in plaque. The most common viral infection of the
mouth is gingivostomatitis caused by herpes simplex. A common fungal infection is candidiasis commonly
known as thrush which affects the mucous membranes of the mouth.
There are a number of esophageal diseases such as the development of Schatzki rings that can restrict the
passageway, causing difficulties in swallowing. They can also completely block the esophagus.[42]
Stomach diseases are often chronic conditions and include gastroparesis, gastritis, and peptic ulcers.
A number of problems including malnutrition and anemia can arise from malabsorption, the abnormal
absorption of nutrients in the GI tract. Malabsorption can have many causes ranging from infection, to
enzyme deficiencies such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. It can also arise as a result of other
gastrointestinal diseases such as coeliac disease. Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the small
intestine. This can cause vitamin deficiencies due to the improper absorption of nutrients in the small
intestine. The small intestine can also be obstructed by a volvulus, a loop of intestine that becomes twisted
enclosing its attached mesentery. This can cause mesenteric ischemia if severe enough.
A common disorder of the bowel is diverticulitis. Diverticula are small pouches that can form inside the
bowel wall, which can become inflamed to give diverticulitis. This disease can have complications if an
inflamed diverticulum bursts and infection sets in. Any infection can spread further to the lining of the
abdomen (peritoneum) and cause potentially fatal peritonitis.[43]

Crohn's disease is a common chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which can affect any part of the
GI tract,[44] but it mostly starts in the terminal ileum.
Ulcerative colitis an ulcerative form of colitis, is the other major inflammatory bowel disease which is
restricted to the colon and rectum. Both of these IBDs can give an increased risk of the development of
colorectal cancer. Ulcerative colitis is the most common of the IBDs[45]
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common of the functional gastrointestinal disorders. These are
idiopathic disorders that the Rome process has helped to define.[46]
Giardiasis is a disease of the small intestine caused by a protist parasite Giardia lamblia. This does not
spread but remains confined to the lumen of the small intestine.[47] It can often be asymptomatic, but as
often can be indicated by a variety of symptoms. Giardiasis is the most common pathogenic parasitic
infection in humans.[48]
There are diagnostic tools mostly involving the ingestion of barium sulphate to investigate disorders of the
GI tract.[49] These are known as upper gastrointestinal series that enable imaging of the pharynx, larynx,
oesophagus, stomach and small intestine[50] and lower gastrointestinal series for imaging of the colon.
Gestation can predispose for certain digestive disorders. Gestational diabetes can develop in the mother as a
result of pregnancy and while this often presents with few symptoms it can lead to pre-eclampsia.[51]
In the early 11th century, the Islamic medical philosopher
Avicenna wrote extensively on many subjects including medicine. Forty of these treatises on medicine
survive, and in the most famous one titled the Canon of Medicine he discusses "rising gas". Avicenna
In pregnancy
History
believed that digestive system dysfunction was responsible for the overproduction of gas in the
gastrointestinal tract. He suggested lifestyle changes and a compound of herbal drugs for its treatment.[52]
In 1497, Alessandro Benedetti viewed the stomach as an unclean organ separated off by the diaphragm.
This view of the stomach and intestines as being base organs was generally held until the mid-17th
century.[53]
In the Renaissance of the 16th century, Leonardo da Vinci produced some early drawings of the stomach
and intestines. He thought that the digestive system aided the respiratory system.[53] Andreas Vesalius
provided some early anatomical drawings of the abdominal organs in the 16th century.
In the middle of the 17th century, a Flemish physician Jan Baptist van Helmont offered the first chemical
account of digestion which was later described as being very close to the later conceptualised enzyme.[53]
In 1653, William Harvey described the intestines in terms of their length, their blood supply, the
mesenteries, and fat (adenylyl cyclase).[53]
In 1823, William Prout discovered hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice.[54] In 1895, Ivan Pavlov described
its secretion as being stimulated by a neurologic reflex with the vagus nerve having a crucial role. Black in
the 19th century suggested an association of histamine with this secretion. In 1916, Popielski described
histamine as a gastric secretagogue of hydrochloric acid.
William Beaumont was an army surgeon who in 1825, was able to observe digestion as it took place in the
stomach.[55] This was made possible by experiments on a man with a stomach wound that did not fully heal
leaving an opening into the stomach. The churning motion of the stomach was described among other
findings.[53]
In the 19th century, it was accepted that chemical processes were involved in the process of digestion.
Physiological research into secretion and the gastrointestinal tract was pursued with experiments undertaken
by Claude Bernard, Rudolph Heidenhain and Ivan Pavlov.
The rest of the 20th century was dominated by research into enzymes. The first to be discovered was
secretin by Ernest Starling in 1902, with ensuing results from John Edkins in 1905 who first suggested
gastrin with its structure being determined in 1964.[54] Andre Latarjet and Lester Dragstedt found a role for
acetylcholine in the digestive system.[54] In 1972, H2 receptor agonists were described by J. Black, that
block the action of histamine and decrease the production of hydrochloric acid. In 1980, proton pump
inhibitors were described by Sachs. In 1983, the role of Helicobacter pylori in the formation of ulcers was
described by Barry Marshall, and Robin Warren.[56]
Art historians have often noted that banqueters on iconographic records of ancient Mediterranean societies
almost always appear to be lying down on their left sides. One possible explanation could lie in the anatomy
of the stomach and in the digestive mechanism. When lying on the left, the food has room to expand
because the curvature of the stomach is enhanced in that position.[57]
