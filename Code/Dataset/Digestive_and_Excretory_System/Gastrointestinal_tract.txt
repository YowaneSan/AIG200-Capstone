Anatomical terminology
Gastrointestinal tract
The gastrointestinal tract (GI tract, digestive tract, alimentary
canal) is the tract or passageway of the digestive system that leads
from the mouth to the anus. The GI tract contains all the major
organs of the digestive system, in humans and other animals,
including the esophagus, stomach, and intestines. Food taken in
through the mouth is digested to extract nutrients and absorb
energy, and the waste expelled at the anus as faeces.
Gastrointestinal is an adjective meaning of or pertaining to the
stomach and intestines.
Most animals have a "through-gut" or complete digestive tract.
Exceptions are more primitive ones: sponges have small pores
(ostia) throughout their body for digestion and a larger dorsal pore
(osculum) for excretion, comb jellies have both a ventral mouth
and dorsal anal pores, while cnidarians and acoels have a single
pore for both digestion and excretion.[1][2]
The human gastrointestinal tract consists of the esophagus,
stomach, and intestines, and is divided into the upper and lower
gastrointestinal tracts.[3] The GI tract includes all structures
between the mouth and the anus,[4] forming a continuous
passageway that includes the main organs of digestion, namely, the
stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. The complete human
digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal tract plus the
accessory organs of digestion (the tongue, salivary glands,
pancreas, liver and gallbladder).[5] The tract may also be divided
into foregut, midgut, and hindgut, reflecting the embryological
origin of each segment. The whole human GI tract is about nine
meters (30 feet) long at autopsy. It is considerably shorter in the
living body because the intestines, which are tubes of smooth
muscle tissue, maintain constant muscle tone in a halfway-tense
state but can relax in spots to allow for local distention and
peristalsis.[6][7]
The gastrointestinal tract contains the gut microbiota, with some
1,000 different strains of bacteria having diverse roles in the
maintenance of immune health and metabolism, and many other
microorganisms.[8][9][10] Cells of the GI tract release hormones to
help regulate the digestive process. These digestive hormones,
including gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin, and ghrelin, are
Illustration of digestive system
mediated through either intracrine or autocrine mechanisms, indicating that the cells releasing these
hormones are conserved structures throughout evolution.[11]
The structure and function can be described both as gross anatomy
and as microscopic anatomy or histology. The tract itself is divided
into upper and lower tracts, and the intestines small and large
parts.[12]
The upper gastrointestinal tract consists of the mouth, pharynx,
esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.[13] The exact demarcation
between the upper and lower tracts is the suspensory muscle of the
duodenum. This differentiates the embryonic borders between the
foregut and midgut, and is also the division commonly used by
clinicians to describe gastrointestinal bleeding as being of either
"upper" or "lower" origin. Upon dissection, the duodenum may
appear to be a unified organ, but it is divided into four segments
based on function, location, and internal anatomy. The four
segments of the duodenum are as follows (starting at the stomach,
and moving toward the jejunum): bulb, descending, horizontal, and
ascending. The suspensory muscle attaches the superior border of
the ascending duodenum to the diaphragm.
The suspensory muscle is an important anatomical landmark that shows the formal division between the
duodenum and the jejunum, the first and second parts of the small intestine, respectively.[14] This is a thin
muscle which is derived from the embryonic mesoderm.
The lower gastrointestinal tract includes most of the small intestine and all of the large intestine.[15] In
human anatomy, the intestine (bowel, or gut. Greek: éntera) is the segment of the gastrointestinal tract
extending from the pyloric sphincter of the stomach to the anus and as in other mammals, consists of two
segments: the small intestine and the large intestine. In humans, the small intestine is further subdivided into
the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum while the large intestine is subdivided into the cecum, ascending,
transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon, rectum, and anal canal.[16][17]
The small intestine begins at the duodenum and is a tubular structure, usually between 6 and 7 m long.[18]
Its mucosal area in an adult human is about 30 m2 (320 sq ft).[19] The combination of the circular folds, the
villi, and the microvilli increases the absorptive area of the mucosa about 600-fold, making a total area of

about 250 m2 (2,700 sq ft) for the entire small intestine.[20] Its main function is to absorb the products of
digestion (including carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and vitamins) into the bloodstream. There are three
major divisions:
1. Duodenum: A short structure (about 20–25 cm long[18]) that receives chyme from the
stomach, together with pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes and bile from the gall
bladder. The digestive enzymes break down proteins, and bile emulsifies fats into micelles.
The duodenum contains Brunner's glands which produce a mucus-rich alkaline secretion
containing bicarbonate. These secretions, in combination with bicarbonate from the
pancreas, neutralize the stomach acids contained in the chyme.
2. Jejunum: This is the midsection of the small intestine, connecting the duodenum to the
ileum. It is about 2.5 m (8.2 ft) long and contains the circular folds also known as plicae
circulares and villi that increase its surface area. Products of digestion (sugars, amino acids,
and fatty acids) are absorbed into the bloodstream here.
3. Ileum: The final section of the small intestine. It is about 3 m long, and contains villi similar to
the jejunum. It absorbs mainly vitamin B12 and bile acids, as well as any other remaining
nutrients.
The large intestine, also called the colon, forms an arch starting at the cecum and ending at the rectum and
anal canal. It also includes the appendix, which is attached to the cecum. Its length is about 1.5 m, and the
area of the mucosa in an adult human is about 2 m2 (22 sq ft).[19] Its main function is to absorb water and
salts. The colon is further divided into:
1. Cecum (first portion of the colon) and appendix
2. Ascending colon (ascending in the back wall of the abdomen)
3. Right colic flexure (flexed portion of the ascending and transverse colon apparent to the
liver)
4. Transverse colon (passing below the diaphragm)
5. Left colic flexure (flexed portion of the transverse and descending colon apparent to the
spleen)
6. Descending colon (descending down the left side of the abdomen)
7. Sigmoid colon (a loop of the colon closest to the rectum)
8. Rectum
9. Anal canal
The gut is an endoderm-derived structure. At approximately the sixteenth day of human development, the
embryo begins to fold ventrally (with the embryo's ventral surface becoming concave) in two directions: the
sides of the embryo fold in on each other and the head and tail fold toward one another. The result is that a
piece of the yolk sac, an endoderm-lined structure in contact with the ventral aspect of the embryo, begins
to be pinched off to become the primitive gut. The yolk sac remains connected to the gut tube via the
vitelline duct. Usually, this structure regresses during development; in cases where it does not, it is known
as Meckel's diverticulum.

Development
General structure of the gut wall
During fetal life, the primitive gut is gradually patterned into three segments: foregut, midgut, and hindgut.
Although these terms are often used in reference to segments of the primitive gut, they are also used
regularly to describe regions of the definitive gut as well.
Each segment of the gut is further specified and gives rise to specific gut and gut-related structures in later
development. Components derived from the gut proper, including the stomach and colon, develop as
swellings or dilatations in the cells of the primitive gut. In contrast, gut-related derivatives — that is, those
structures that derive from the primitive gut but are not part of the gut proper, in general, develop as out-
pouchings of the primitive gut. The blood vessels supplying these structures remain constant throughout
development.[21]

The gastrointestinal tract has a form of general
histology with some differences that reflect the
specialization in functional anatomy.[22] The GI tract
can be divided into four concentric layers in the
following order:
Mucosa
Submucosa
Muscular layer
Adventitia or serosa
The mucosa is the innermost layer of the gastrointestinal tract. The mucosa surrounds the lumen, or open
space within the tube. This layer comes in direct contact with digested food (chyme). The mucosa is made
up of:
Epithelium – innermost layer. Responsible for most digestive, absorptive and secretory
processes.
Lamina propria – a layer of connective tissue. Unusually cellular compared to most
connective tissue
Muscularis mucosae – a thin layer of smooth muscle that aids the passing of material and
enhances the interaction between the epithelial layer and the contents of the lumen by
Histology
Mucosa
agitation and peristalsis
The mucosae are highly specialized in each organ of the gastrointestinal tract to deal with the different
conditions. The most variation is seen in the epithelium.
The submucosa consists of a dense irregular layer of connective tissue with large blood vessels, lymphatics,
and nerves branching into the mucosa and muscularis externa. It contains the submucosal plexus, an enteric
nervous plexus, situated on the inner surface of the muscularis externa.
The muscular layer consists of an inner circular layer and a longitudinal outer layer. The circular layer
prevents food from traveling backward and the longitudinal layer shortens the tract. The layers are not truly
longitudinal or circular, rather the layers of muscle are helical with different pitches. The inner circular is
helical with a steep pitch and the outer longitudinal is helical with a much shallower pitch.[23] Whilst the
muscularis externa is similar throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract, an exception is the stomach which
has an additional inner oblique muscular layer to aid with grinding and mixing of food. The muscularis
externa of the stomach is composed of the inner oblique layer, middle circular layer, and outer longitudinal
layer.
Between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers is the myenteric plexus. This controls peristalsis.
Activity is initiated by the pacemaker cells, (myenteric interstitial cells of Cajal). The gut has intrinsic
peristaltic activity (basal electrical rhythm) due to its self-contained enteric nervous system. The rate can be
modulated by the rest of the autonomic nervous system.[23]
The coordinated contractions of these layers is called peristalsis and propels the food through the tract. Food
in the GI tract is called a bolus (ball of food) from the mouth down to the stomach. After the stomach, the
food is partially digested and semi-liquid, and is referred to as chyme. In the large intestine, the remaining
semi-solid substance is referred to as faeces.[23]
The outermost layer of the gastrointestinal tract consists of several layers of connective tissue.
Intraperitoneal parts of the GI tract are covered with serosa. These include most of the stomach, first part of
the duodenum, all of the small intestine, caecum and appendix, transverse colon, sigmoid colon and rectum.
In these sections of the gut, there is a clear boundary between the gut and the surrounding tissue. These
parts of the tract have a mesentery.
Retroperitoneal parts are covered with adventitia. They blend into the surrounding tissue and are fixed in
position. For example, the retroperitoneal section of the duodenum usually passes through the transpyloric
plane. These include the esophagus, pylorus of the stomach, distal duodenum, ascending colon, descending
colon and anal canal. In addition, the oral cavity has adventitia.

Gene and protein expression
Approximately 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and 75% of these genes are
expressed in at least one of the different parts of the digestive organ system.[24][25] Over 600 of these genes
are more specifically expressed in one or more parts of the GI tract and the corresponding proteins have
functions related to digestion of food and uptake of nutrients. Examples of specific proteins with such
functions are pepsinogen PGC and the lipase LIPF, expressed in chief cells, and gastric ATPase ATP4A and
gastric intrinsic factor GIF, expressed in parietal cells of the stomach mucosa. Specific proteins expressed in
the stomach and duodenum involved in defence include mucin proteins, such as mucin 6 and intelectin-
1.[26]
The time taken for food to transit through the gastrointestinal tract varies on multiple factors, including age,
ethnicity, and gender.[27][28] Several techniques have been used to measure transit time, including
radiography following a barium-labeled meal, breath hydrogen analysis, scintigraphic analysis following a
radiolabeled meal,[29] and simple ingestion and spotting of corn kernels.[30] It takes 2.5 to 3 hours for 50%
of the contents to leave the stomach. The rate of digestion is also dependent of the material being digested,
as food composition from the same meal may leave the stomach at different rates.[31] Total emptying of the
stomach takes around 4–5 hours, and transit through the colon takes 30 to 50 hours.[29][32][33]
The gastrointestinal tract forms an important part of the immune system.[34]
The surface area of the digestive tract is estimated to be about 32 square meters, or about half a badminton
court.[19] With such a large exposure (more than three times larger than the exposed surface of the skin),
these immune components function to prevent pathogens from entering the blood and lymph circulatory
systems.[35] Fundamental components of this protection are provided by the intestinal mucosal barrier,
which is composed of physical, biochemical, and immune elements elaborated by the intestinal mucosa.[36]
Microorganisms also are kept at bay by an extensive immune system comprising the gut-associated
lymphoid tissue (GALT)
There are additional factors contributing to protection from pathogen invasion. For example, low pH
(ranging from 1 to 4) of the stomach is fatal for many microorganisms that enter it.[37] Similarly, mucus
(containing IgA antibodies) neutralizes many pathogenic microorganisms.[38] Other factors in the GI tract
contribution to immune function include enzymes secreted in the saliva and bile.
Beneficial bacteria also can contribute to the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal immune system. For
example, Clostridia, one of the most predominant bacterial groups in the GI tract, play an important role in
influencing the dynamics of the gut's immune system.[39] It has been demonstrated that the intake of a high
fiber diet could be responsible for the induction of T-regulatory cells (Tregs). This is due to the production
of short-chain fatty acids during the fermentation of plant-derived nutrients such as butyrate and propionate.

Immune system homeostasis
Basically, the butyrate induces the differentiation of Treg cells by enhancing histone H3 acetylation in the
promoter and conserved non-coding sequence regions of the FOXP3 locus, thus regulating the T cells,
resulting in the reduction of the inflammatory response and allergies.
The large intestine contains multiple types of bacteria that can break down molecules the human body
cannot process alone,[40] demonstrating a symbiotic relationship. These bacteria are responsible for gas
production at host–pathogen interface, which is released as flatulence. However, the primary function of the
large intestine is water absorption from digested material (regulated by the hypothalamus) and the
reabsorption of sodium and nutrients.[41]
Beneficial intestinal bacteria compete with potentially harmful bacteria for space and "food", as the
intestinal tract has limited resources. A ratio of 80–85% beneficial to 15–20% potentially harmful bacteria is
proposed for maintaining homeostasis. An imbalanced ratio results in dysbiosis.
Enzymes such as CYP3A4, along with the antiporter activities, are also instrumental in the intestine's role of
drug metabolism in the detoxification of antigens and xenobiotics.[42]
In most vertebrates, including fishes, amphibians, birds, reptiles, and egg-laying mammals, the
gastrointestinal tract ends in a cloaca and not an anus. In the cloaca, the urinary system is fused with the
genito-anal pore. Therians (all mammals that do not lay eggs, including humans) possess separate anal and
uro-genital openings. The females of the subgroup placentalia have even separate urinary and genital
openings.
During early development the asymmetric position of the bowels and inner organs is initiated (see also axial
twist theory).
Ruminants show many specializations for digesting and fermenting tough plant material, consisting of
additional stomach compartments.
Many birds and other animals have a specialised stomach in the digestive tract called a gizzard used for
grinding up food.
Another feature found in a range of animals is the crop. In birds this is found as a pouch alongside the
esophagus.
In 2020, the oldest known fossil digestive tract, of an extinct wormlike organism in the Cloudinidae was
discovered; it lived during the late Ediacaran period about 550 million years ago.[43][44]
A through-gut (one with both mouth and anus) is thought to have evolved within the nephrozoan clade of
Bilateria, after their ancestral ventral orifice (single, as in cnidarians and acoels; re-evolved in nephrozoans
like flatworms) stretched antero-posteriorly, before the middle part of the stretch would get narrower and
closed fully, leaving an anterior orifice (mouth) and a posterior orifice (anus plus genital opening). A
stretched gut without the middle part closed is present in another branch of bilaterians, the extinct

proarticulates. This and the amphistomic development (when both mouth and anus develop from the gut
stretch in the embryo) present in some nephrozoans (e.g. roundworms) are considered to support this
hypothesis.[45][46]
There are many diseases and conditions that can affect the gastrointestinal system, including infections,
inflammation and cancer.
Various pathogens, such as bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses, can induce gastroenteritis which results
from inflammation of the stomach and small intestine. Antibiotics to treat such bacterial infections can
decrease the microbiome diversity of the gastrointestinal tract, and further enable inflammatory
mediators.[47] Gastroenteritis is the most common disease of the GI tract.
Gastrointestinal cancer may occur at any point in the gastrointestinal tract, and includes
mouth cancer, tongue cancer, oesophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and colorectal cancer.
Inflammatory conditions. Ileitis is an inflammation of the ileum, colitis is an inflammation of
the large intestine.
Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix located at the caecum. This is a potentially fatal
condition if left untreated; most cases of appendicitis require surgical intervention.
Diverticular disease is a condition that is very common in older people in industrialized countries. It usually
affects the large intestine but has been known to affect the small intestine as well. Diverticulosis occurs
when pouches form on the intestinal wall. Once the pouches become inflamed it is known as diverticulitis.
Inflammatory bowel disease is an inflammatory condition affecting the bowel walls, and includes the
subtypes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. While Crohn's can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract,
ulcerative colitis is limited to the large intestine. Crohn's disease is widely regarded as an autoimmune
disease. Although ulcerative colitis is often treated as though it were an autoimmune disease, there is no
consensus that it actually is such.
Functional gastrointestinal disorders the most common of which is irritable bowel syndrome. Functional
constipation and chronic functional abdominal pain are other functional disorders of the intestine that have
physiological causes but do not have identifiable structural, chemical, or infectious pathologies.
Several symptoms can indicate problems with the gastrointestinal tract, including:
Vomiting, which may include regurgitation of food or the vomiting of blood
Diarrhea, or the passage of liquid or more frequent stools
Constipation, which refers to the passage of fewer and hardened stools
Blood in stool, which includes fresh red blood, maroon-coloured blood, and tarry-coloured
blood

Gastrointestinal surgery can often be performed in the outpatient setting. In the United States in 2012,
operations on the digestive system accounted for 3 of the 25 most common ambulatory surgery procedures
and constituted 9.1 percent of all outpatient ambulatory surgeries.[48]
Various methods of imaging the gastrointestinal tract include the upper and lower gastrointestinal series:
Radioopaque dyes may be swallowed to produce a barium swallow
Parts of the tract may be visualised by camera. This is known as endoscopy if examining the
upper gastrointestinal tract and colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy if examining the lower
gastrointestinal tract. Capsule endoscopy is where a capsule containing a camera is
swallowed in order to examine the tract. Biopsies may also be taken when examined.
An abdominal x-ray may be used to examine the lower gastrointestinal tract.

Helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative spiral bacterium. Over half the world's population is
infected with it, mainly during childhood; it is not certain how the disease is transmitted. It
colonizes the gastrointestinal system, predominantly the stomach. The bacterium has
specific survival conditions that are specific to the human gastric microenvironment: it is both
capnophilic and microaerophilic. Helicobacter also exhibits a tropism for gastric epithelial
lining and the gastric mucosal layer about it. Gastric colonization of this bacterium triggers a
robust immune response leading to moderate to severe inflammation, known as gastritis.
Signs and symptoms of infection are gastritis, burning abdominal pain, weight loss, loss of
appetite, bloating, burping, nausea, bloody vomit, and black tarry stools. Infection can be
detected in a number of ways: GI X-rays, endoscopy, blood tests for anti-Helicobacter
antibodies, a stool test, and a urease breath test (which is a by-product of the bacteria). If
caught soon enough, it can be treated with three doses of different proton pump inhibitors as
well as two antibiotics, taking about a week to cure. If not caught soon enough, surgery may
be required.[49][50][51][52]
Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a syndrome caused by a malformation of the digestive
system, characterized by a severe impairment in the ability of the intestines to push and
assimilate. Symptoms include daily abdominal and stomach pain, nausea, severe
distension, vomiting, heartburn, dysphagia, diarrhea, constipation, dehydration and
malnutrition. There is no cure for intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Different types of surgery and
treatment managing life-threatening complications such as ileus and volvulus, intestinal
stasis which lead to bacterial overgrowth, and resection of affected or dead parts of the gut
may be needed. Many patients require parenteral nutrition.
Ileus is a blockage of the intestines.
Coeliac disease is a common form of malabsorption, affecting up to 1% of people of northern
European descent. An autoimmune response is triggered in intestinal cells by digestion of
gluten proteins. Ingestion of proteins found in wheat, barley and rye, causes villous atrophy

in the small intestine. Lifelong dietary avoidance of these foodstuffs in a gluten-free diet is
the only treatment.
Enteroviruses are named by their transmission-route through the intestine (enteric meaning
intestinal), but their symptoms are not mainly associated with the intestine.
Endometriosis can affect the intestines, with similar symptoms to IBS.
Bowel twist (or similarly, bowel strangulation) is a comparatively rare event (usually
developing sometime after major bowel surgery). It is, however, hard to diagnose correctly,
and if left uncorrected can lead to bowel infarction and death. (The singer Maurice Gibb is
understood to have died from this.)

Intestines from animals other than humans are used in a number of ways. From each species of livestock
that is a source of milk, a corresponding rennet is obtained from the intestines of milk-fed calves. Pig and
calf intestines are eaten, and pig intestines are used as sausage casings. Calf intestines supply calf-intestinal
alkaline phosphatase (CIP), and are used to make goldbeater's skin. Other uses are:
The use of animal gut strings by musicians can be traced back to the third dynasty of Egypt.
In the recent past, strings were made out of lamb gut. With the advent of the modern era,
musicians have tended to use strings made of silk, or synthetic materials such as nylon or
steel. Some instrumentalists, however, still use gut strings in order to evoke the older tone
quality. Although such strings were commonly referred to as "catgut" strings, cats were never
used as a source for gut strings.[53]
Sheep gut was the original source for natural gut string used in racquets, such as for tennis.
Today, synthetic strings are much more common, but the best gut strings are now made out
of cow gut.
Gut cord has also been used to produce strings for the snares that provide a snare drum's
characteristic buzzing timbre. While the modern snare drum almost always uses metal wire
rather than gut cord, the North African bendir frame drum still uses gut for this purpose.
"Natural" sausage hulls, or casings, are made of animal gut, especially hog, beef, and lamb.
The wrapping of kokoretsi, gardoubakia, and torcinello is made of lamb (or goat) gut.
Haggis is traditionally boiled in, and served in, a sheep stomach.
Chitterlings, a kind of food, consist of thoroughly washed pig's gut.
Animal gut was used to make the cord lines in longcase clocks and for fusee movements in
bracket clocks, but may be replaced by metal wire.
The oldest known condoms, from 1640 AD, were made from animal intestine.[54]
