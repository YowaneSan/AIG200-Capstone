Stomach
The stomach is a muscular, hollow organ in the upper
gastrointestinal tract of humans and many other animals,
including several invertebrates. The stomach has a dilated
structure and functions as a vital organ in the digestive system.
The stomach is involved in the gastric phase of digestion,
following the cephalic phase in which the sight and smell of
food and the act of chewing are stimuli. In the stomach a
chemical breakdown of food takes place by means of secreted
digestive enzymes and gastric acid.
The stomach is located between the esophagus and the small
intestine. The pyloric sphincter controls the passage of partially
digested food (chyme) from the stomach into the duodenum,
the first and shortest part of the small intestine, where peristalsis
takes over to move this through the rest of the intestines.
In the human digestive system, the stomach lies between the
esophagus and the duodenum (the first part of the small
intestine). It is in the left upper quadrant of the abdominal
cavity. The top of the stomach lies against the diaphragm. Lying
behind the stomach is the pancreas. A large double fold of
visceral peritoneum called the greater omentum hangs down
from the greater curvature of the stomach. Two sphincters keep
the contents of the stomach contained; the lower esophageal
sphincter (found in the cardiac region), at the junction of the
esophagus and stomach, and the pyloric sphincter at the
junction of the stomach with the duodenum.
The stomach is surrounded by parasympathetic (stimulant) and
sympathetic (inhibitor) plexuses (networks of blood vessels and
nerves in the anterior gastric, posterior, superior and inferior,
celiac and myenteric), which regulate both the secretory activity
of the stomach and the motor (motion) activity of its muscles.
The stomach is distensible, and can normally expand to hold
about one litre of food.[3] In a newborn human baby the
stomach will only be able to hold about 30 millilitres. The

stomach
maximum stomach volume in adults is between 2 and 4
litres.[4][5] Although volumes of up to 15 L have been observed
in extreme circumstances.[6]
The human stomach can be divided into four sections,
beginning at the cardia followed by the fundus, the body and
the pylorus.[7][8]
The gastric cardia is where the contents of the
esophagus empty from the gastroesophageal
sphincter into the cardiac orifice, the opening into the
gastric cardia.[9][8] A cardiac notch at the left of the
cardiac orifice, marks the beginning of the greater
curvature of the stomach. A horizontal line across
from the cardiac notch gives the dome-shaped region
called the fundus.[8] The cardia is a very small region
of the stomach that surrounds the esophageal
opening.[8]
The fundus (from Latin 'bottom') is formed in the
upper curved part.
The body or corpus is the main, central region of the
stomach.
The pylorus opens to the body of the stomach. The
pylorus (from Greek 'gatekeeper') connects the
stomach to the duodenum at the pyloric sphincter.
The cardia is defined as the region following the "z-line" of the
gastroesophageal junction, the point at which the epithelium
changes from stratified squamous to columnar. Near the cardia
is the lower esophageal sphincter.[9]
The stomach bed refers to the structures upon which the stomach
rests in mammals.[10][11] These include the tail of the pancreas,
splenic artery, left kidney, left suprarenal gland, transverse colon
and its mesocolon, and the left crus of diaphragm, and the left colic
flexure. The term was introduced around 1896 by Philip Polson of
the Catholic University School of Medicine, Dublin. However this
was 
brought

disrepute 
by

Massey.[12][13][14]
The lesser curvature of the human stomach is supplied by the right gastric artery inferiorly and the left
gastric artery superiorly, which also supplies the cardiac region. The greater curvature is supplied by the
right gastroepiploic artery inferiorly and the left gastroepiploic artery superiorly. The fundus of the stomach,

The gastrointestinal wall of the
human stomach
Layers of the gastrointestinal wall of
which the stomach is a dilated part
and also the upper portion of the greater curvature, is supplied
by the short gastric arteries, which arise from the splenic artery.
The two sets of gastric lymph nodes drain the stomach.
Like the other parts of the gastrointestinal wall, the human stomach
wall from inner to outer, consists of a mucosa, submucosa, muscular
layer, subserosa and serosa.[16]
The inner part of the stomach wall is the gastric mucosa a mucous
membrane that forms the lining of the stomach. the membrane
consists of an outer layer of columnar epithelium, a lamina propria,
and a thin layer of smooth muscle called the muscularis mucosa.
Beneath the mucosa lies the submucosa, consisting of fibrous
connective tissue.[17] Meissner's plexus is in this layer interior to the
oblique muscle layer.[18]
Outside of the submucosa lies the muscular layer. It consists of three
layers of muscular fibres, with fibres lying at angles to each other.
These are the inner oblique, middle circular, and outer longitudinal
layers.[19] The presence of the inner oblique layer is distinct from
other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, which do not possess this
layer.[20] The stomach contains the thickest muscular layer
consisting of three layers, thus maximum peristalsis occurs here.
The inner oblique layer: This layer is responsible for creating the motion that churns and
physically breaks down the food. It is the only layer of the three which is not seen in other
parts of the digestive system. The antrum has thicker skin cells in its walls and performs
more forceful contractions than the fundus.
The middle circular layer: At this layer, the pylorus is surrounded by a thick circular muscular
wall, which is normally tonically constricted, forming a functional (if not anatomically discrete)
pyloric sphincter, which controls the movement of chyme into the duodenum. This layer is
concentric to the longitudinal axis of the stomach.
The myenteric plexus (Auerbach's plexus) is found between the outer longitudinal and the
middle circular layer and is responsible for the innervation of both (causing peristalsis and
mixing).
The outer longitudinal layer is responsible for moving the semi-digested food towards the pylorus of the
stomach through muscular shortening.
To the outside of the muscular layer lies a serosa, consisting of layers of connective tissue continuous with
the peritoneum.

Fundic glands are simple, branched
tubular glands that extend from the
bottom of the gastric pits to the
muscularis mucosae; the more
distinctive cells are parietal cells.
H&E stain.
Smooth mucosa along the inside of the lesser curvature forms a passageway - the gastric canal that fast-
tracks liquids entering the stomach, to the pylorus.[8]
The mucosa lining the stomach is lined with gastric pits, which
receive gastric juice, secreted by between 2 and 7 gastric glands.
Gastric juice is an acidic fluid containing hydrochloric acid and the
digestive enzyme pepsin. The glands contains a number of cells,
with the function of the glands changing depending on their
position within the stomach.
Within the body and fundus of the stomach lie the fundic glands. In
general, these glands are lined by column-shaped cells that secrete a
protective layer of mucus and bicarbonate. Additional cells present
include parietal cells that secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic
factor, chief cells that secrete pepsinogen (this is a precursor to
pepsin- the highly acidic environment converts the pepsinogen to
pepsin), and neuroendocrine cells that secrete serotonin.[21]
Glands differ where the stomach meets the esophagus and near the
pylorus.[22] Near the gastroesophageal junction lie cardiac glands,
which primarily secrete mucus.[21] They are fewer in number than
the other gastric glands and are more shallowly positioned in the
mucosa. There are two kinds - either simple tubular glands with
short ducts or compound racemose resembling the duodenal
Brunner's glands. Near the pylorus lie pyloric glands located in the
antrum of the pylorus. They secrete mucus, as well as gastrin
produced by their G cells.[23]
About 20,000 protein-coding genes are expressed in human cells
and nearly 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal
stomach.[24][25] Just over 150 of these genes are more specifically
expressed in the stomach compared to other organs, with only some 20 genes being highly specific. The
corresponding specific proteins expressed in stomach are mainly involved in creating a suitable environment
for handling the digestion of food for uptake of nutrients. Highly stomach-specific proteins include
gastrokine-1 expressed in the mucosa; pepsinogen and lipase, expressed in gastric chief cells; and a gastric
ATPase and gastric intrinsic factor, expressed in parietal cells.[26]
In the early part of the development of the human embryo, the ventral part of the embryo abuts the yolk sac.
During the third week of development, as the embryo grows, it begins to surround parts of the yolk sac.
The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract.[27] The sac is surrounded by a
network of vitelline arteries and veins. Over time, these arteries consolidate into the three main arteries that
supply the developing gastrointestinal tract: the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior

mesenteric artery. The areas supplied by these arteries are used to
define the foregut, midgut, and hindgut.[27] The surrounded sac
becomes the primitive gut. Sections of this gut begin to differentiate
into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, and the esophagus, and
stomach form from the foregut.[27]
As the stomach rotates during early development, the dorsal and
ventral mesentery rotate with it; this rotation produces a space
anterior to the expanding stomach called the greater sac, and a
space posterior to the stomach called the lesser sac. After this
rotation the dorsal mesentery thins and forms the greater omentum,
which is attached to the greater curvature of the stomach. The
ventral mesentery forms the lesser omentum, and is attached to the
developing liver. In the adult, these connective structures of
omentum and mesentery form the peritoneum, and act as an
insulating and protective layer while also supplying organs with
blood and lymph vessels as well as nerves.[28] Arterial supply to all these structures is from the celiac trunk,
and venous drainage is by the portal venous system. Lymph from these organs is drained to the prevertebral
celiac nodes at the origin of the celiac artery from the aorta.
In the human digestive system, a bolus (a small rounded mass of chewed up food) enters the stomach
through the esophagus via the lower esophageal sphincter. The stomach releases proteases (protein-
digesting enzymes such as pepsin), and hydrochloric acid, which kills or inhibits bacteria and provides the
acidic pH of 2 for the proteases to work. Food is churned by the stomach through peristaltic muscular
contractions of the wall – reducing the volume of the bolus, before looping around the fundus[29] and the
body of stomach as the boluses are converted into chyme (partially digested food). Chyme slowly passes
through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum of the small intestine, where the extraction of nutrients
begins.
Gastric juice in the stomach also contains pepsinogen. Hydrochloric acid activates this inactive form of
enzyme into the active form, pepsin. Pepsin breaks down proteins into polypeptides.
Within a few moments after food enters the stomach, mixing waves begin to occur at intervals of
approximately 20 seconds. A mixing wave is a unique type of peristalsis that mixes and softens the food
with gastric juices to create chyme. The initial mixing waves are relatively gentle, but these are followed by
more intense waves, starting at the body of the stomach and increasing in force as they reach the pylorus.
The pylorus, which holds around 30 mL of chyme, acts as a filter, permitting only liquids and small food
particles to pass through the mostly, but not fully, closed pyloric sphincter. In a process called gastric
emptying, rhythmic mixing waves force about 3 mL of chyme at a time through the pyloric sphincter and
into the duodenum. Release of a greater amount of chyme at one time would overwhelm the capacity of the

small intestine to handle it. The rest of the chyme is pushed back into the body of the stomach, where it
continues mixing. This process is repeated when the next mixing waves force more chyme into the
duodenum.
Gastric emptying is regulated by both the stomach and the duodenum. The presence of chyme in the
duodenum activates receptors that inhibit gastric secretion. This prevents additional chyme from being
released by the stomach before the duodenum is ready to process it.[30]
The fundus stores both undigested food and gases that are released during the process of chemical
digestion. Food may sit in the fundus of the stomach for a while before being mixed with the chyme. While
the food is in the fundus, the digestive activities of salivary amylase continue until the food begins mixing
with the acidic chyme. Ultimately, mixing waves incorporate this food with the chyme, the acidity of which
inactivates salivary amylase and activates lingual lipase. Lingual lipase then begins breaking down
triglycerides into free fatty acids, and mono- and diglycerides.
The breakdown of protein begins in the stomach through the actions of hydrochloric acid, and the enzyme
pepsin.
The contents of the stomach are completely emptied into the duodenum within two to four hours after the
meal is eaten. Different types of food take different amounts of time to process. Foods heavy in
carbohydrates empty fastest, followed by high-protein foods. Meals with a high triglyceride content remain
in the stomach the longest. Since enzymes in the small intestine digest fats slowly, food can stay in the
stomach for 6 hours or longer when the duodenum is processing fatty chyme. However, this is still a
fraction of the 24 to 72 hours that full digestion typically takes from start to finish.[30]
Although the absorption in the human digestive system is mainly a function of the small intestine, some
absorption of certain small molecules nevertheless does occur in the stomach through its lining. This
includes:
Water, if the body is dehydrated
Medication, such as aspirin
Amino acids[31]
10–20% of ingested ethanol (e.g. from alcoholic beverages)[32]
Caffeine[33]
To a small extent water-soluble vitamins (most are absorbed in the small intestine)[34]
Chemical digestion
Absorption
The parietal cells of the human stomach are responsible for producing intrinsic factor, which is necessary for
the absorption of vitamin B12. B12 is used in cellular metabolism and is necessary for the production of red
blood cells, and the functioning of the nervous system.
Emptying of stomach chyme into the duodenum through the pyloric sphincter
Chyme from the stomach is slowly released into the duodenum through coordinated peristalsis and opening
of the pyloric sphincter. The movement and the flow of chemicals into the stomach are controlled by both
the autonomic nervous system and by the various digestive hormones of the digestive system:
Gastrin
The hormone gastrin causes an increase in the secretion of HCl from the parietal cells and
pepsinogen from chief cells in the stomach. It also causes increased motility in the
stomach. Gastrin is released by G cells in the stomach in response to distension of the
antrum and digestive products (especially large quantities of incompletely digested proteins).
It is inhibited by a pH normally less than 4(high acid), as well as the hormone somatostatin.
Cholecystokinin
Cholecystokinin (CCK) has most effect on the gall bladder, causing gall bladder contractions,
but it also decreases gastric emptying and increases release of pancreatic juice, which is
alkaline and neutralizes the chyme. CCK is synthesized by I-cells in the mucosal epithelium
of the small intestine.
Secretin
In a different and rare manner, secretin, which has the most effects on the pancreas, also
diminishes acid secretion in the stomach. Secretin is synthesized by S-cells, which are
located in the duodenal mucosa as well as in the jejunal mucosa in smaller numbers.
Gastric inhibitory
polypeptide
Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) decreases both gastric acid release and motility. GIP is
synthesized by K-cells, which are located in the duodenal and jejunal mucosa.
Enteroglucagon
Enteroglucagon decreases both gastric acid and motility.
Other than gastrin, these hormones all act to turn off the stomach action. This is in response to food
products in the liver and gall bladder, which have not yet been absorbed. The stomach needs to push food
into the small intestine only when the intestine is not busy. While the intestine is full and still digesting food,
the stomach acts as storage for food.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) results in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival.[35] EGF is a
low-molecular-weight polypeptide first purified from the mouse submandibular gland, but since then found
in many human tissues including the submandibular gland, and the parotid gland. Salivary EGF, which also
seems to be regulated by dietary inorganic iodine, also plays an important physiological role in the
maintenance of oro-esophageal and gastric tissue integrity. The biological effects of salivary EGF include
healing of oral and gastroesophageal ulcers, inhibition of gastric acid secretion, stimulation of DNA
synthesis, and mucosal protection from intraluminal injurious factors such as gastric acid, bile acids, pepsin,
and trypsin and from physical, chemical, and bacterial agents.[36]
Stomach as nutrition sensor
The human stomach has receptors responsive to sodium glutamate[37] and this information is passed to the
lateral hypothalamus and limbic system in the brain as a palatability signal through the vagus nerve.[38] The
stomach can also sense, independently of tongue and oral taste receptors, glucose,[39] carbohydrates,[40]
proteins,[40] and fats.[41] This allows the brain to link nutritional value of foods to their tastes.[39]
Thyrogastric syndrome
This syndrome defines the association between thyroid disease and chronic gastritis, which was first
described in the 1960s.[42] This term was coined also to indicate the presence of thyroid autoantibodies or
autoimmune thyroid disease in patients with pernicious anemia, a late clinical stage of atrophic gastritis.[43]
In 1993, a more complete investigation on the stomach and thyroid was published,[44] reporting that the
thyroid is, embryogenetically and phylogenetically, derived from a primitive stomach, and that the thyroid
cells, such as primitive gastroenteric cells, migrated and specialized in uptake of iodide and in storage and
elaboration of iodine compounds during vertebrate evolution. In fact, the stomach and thyroid share iodine-
concentrating ability and many morphological and functional similarities, such as cell polarity and apical
microvilli, similar organ-specific antigens and associated autoimmune diseases, secretion of glycoproteins
(thyroglobulin and mucin) and peptide hormones, the digesting and readsorbing ability, and lastly, similar
ability to form iodotyrosines by peroxidase activity, where iodide acts as an electron donor in the presence
of H2O2. In the following years, many researchers published reviews about this syndrome.[45]
A series of radiographs can be used to examine the stomach for
various disorders. This will often include the use of a barium
swallow. Another method of examination of the stomach, is the use
of an endoscope. A gastric emptying study is considered the gold
standard to assess the gastric emptying rate.[46]
A large number of studies have indicated that most cases of peptic
ulcers, and gastritis, in humans are caused by Helicobacter pylori
infection, and an association has been seen with the development of
stomach cancer.[47]

Many other variations exist among the mammals.[58][59]
A stomach rumble is actually noise from the intestines.
In humans, many bariatric surgery procedures involve the stomach,
in order to lose weight. A gastric band may be placed around the
cardia area, which can adjust to limit intake. The anatomy of the
stomach may be modified, or the stomach may be bypassed entirely.
Surgical removal of the stomach is called a gastrectomy, and
removal of the cardia area is a called a cardiectomy.
"Cardiectomy" is a term that is also used to describe the removal of
the heart.[48][49][50] A gastrectomy may be carried out because of
gastric cancer or severe perforation of the stomach wall.
Fundoplication is stomach surgery in which the fundus is wrapped around the lower esophagus and stitched
into place. It is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).[51]
The word stomach is derived from Greek stomachos (στόμαχος), ultimately from stoma (στόμα)
'mouth'.[52] Gastro- and gastric (meaning 'related to the stomach') are both derived from Greek gaster
(γαστήρ) 'belly'.[53][54][55]
Although the precise shape and size of the stomach varies widely among different vertebrates, the relative
positions of the esophageal and duodenal openings remain relatively constant. As a result, the organ always
curves somewhat to the left before curving back to meet the pyloric sphincter. However, lampreys,
hagfishes, chimaeras, lungfishes, and some teleost fish have no stomach at all, with the esophagus opening
directly into the intestine. These animals all consume diets that require little storage of food, no predigestion
with gastric juices, or both.[56]

Other animals
The gastric lining is usually divided into two regions, an anterior portion lined by fundic glands and a
posterior portion lined with pyloric glands. Cardiac glands are unique to mammals, and even then are absent
in a number of species. The distributions of these glands vary between species, and do not always
correspond with the same regions as in humans. Furthermore, in many non-human mammals, a portion of
the stomach anterior to the cardiac glands is lined with epithelium essentially identical to that of the
esophagus. Ruminants, in particular, have a complex stomach, the first three chambers of which are all lined
with esophageal mucosa.[56]
In birds and crocodilians, the stomach is divided into two regions. Anteriorly is a narrow tubular region, the
proventriculus, lined by fundic glands, and connecting the true stomach to the crop. Beyond lies the
powerful muscular gizzard, lined by pyloric glands, and, in some species, containing stones that the animal
swallows to help grind up food.[56]
In insects, there is also a crop. The insect stomach is called the midgut.
Information about the stomach in echinoderms or molluscs can be found under the respective articles.
