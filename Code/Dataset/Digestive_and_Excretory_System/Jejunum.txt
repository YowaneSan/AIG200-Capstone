Jejunum
The jejunum is the second part of the small intestine in humans
and most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and
birds. Its lining is specialized for the absorption by enterocytes
of small nutrient molecules which have been previously
digested by enzymes in the duodenum.
The jejunum lies between the duodenum and the ileum and is
considered to start at the suspensory muscle of the duodenum, a
location called the duodenojejunal flexure.[4] The division
between the jejunum and ileum is not anatomically distinct.[5]
In adult humans, the small intestine is usually 6–7 m (20–23 ft)
long (post mortem), about two-fifths of which (about 2.5  m
(8.2 ft)) is the jejunum.[4]
The interior surface of the jejunum—which is exposed to
ingested food—is covered in finger–like projections of mucosa,
called villi, which increase the surface area of tissue available to
absorb nutrients from ingested foodstuffs. The epithelial cells
which line these villi have microvilli. The transport of nutrients
across epithelial cells through the jejunum and ileum includes
the passive transport of sugar fructose and the active transport
of amino acids, small peptides, vitamins, and most glucose. The
villi in the jejunum are much longer than in the duodenum or
ileum.
The pH in the jejunum is usually between 7 and 8 (neutral or
slightly alkaline).
The jejunum and the ileum are suspended by mesentery which
gives the bowel great mobility within the abdomen. It also
contains circular and longitudinal smooth muscle which helps
to move food along by a process known as peristalsis.
The jejunum contains very few Brunner's glands (found in the
duodenum) or Peyer's patches (found in the ileum). However,
there are a few jejunal lymph nodes suspended in its mesentery.
The jejunum has many large circular folds in its submucosa

Anatomical terminology
called plicae circulares that increase the surface area for nutrient
absorption. The plicae circulares are best developed in the
jejunum.
There is no line of demarcation between the jejunum and the
ileum. However, there are subtle histological differences:
The jejunum has less fat inside its mesentery than
the ileum.
The jejunum is typically of larger diameter than the
ileum.
The villi of the jejunum look like long, finger-like
projections, and are a histologically identifiable
structure.
While the length of the entire intestinal tract contains
lymphoid tissue, only the ileum has abundant Peyer's
patches, which are unencapsulated lymphoid nodules that contain large numbers of
lymphocytes and immune cells, like microfold cells.

The lining of the jejunum is specialized for the absorption by enterocytes of small nutrient particles which
have been previously digested by enzymes in the duodenum. Once absorbed, nutrients (with the exception
of fat, which goes to the lymph) pass from the enterocytes into the enterohepatic circulation and enter the
liver via the hepatic portal vein, where the blood is processed.[6]
In fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear and the terms middle intestine or mid-gut may
be used instead of jejunum.[7]
Jejunum is derived from the Latin word jējūnus (iēiūnus), meaning "fasting." It was so called because this
part of the small intestine was frequently found to be void of food following death,[8] due to its intensive
peristaltic activity relative to the duodenum and ileum.
