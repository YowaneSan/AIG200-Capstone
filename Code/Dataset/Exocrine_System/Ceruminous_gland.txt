Ceruminous gland
Ceruminous glands are specialized sudoriferous glands (sweat glands) located subcutaneously in the
external auditory canal, in the outer third. Ceruminous glands are simple, coiled, tubular glands made up of
an inner secretory layer of cells and an outer myoepithelial layer of cells.[1] They are classed as apocrine
glands. The glands drain into larger ducts, which then drain into the guard hairs that reside in the external
auditory canal.[2] Here they produce cerumen, or earwax, by mixing their secretion with sebum and dead
epidermal cells. Cerumen keeps the eardrum pliable, lubricates and cleans the external auditory canal,
waterproofs the canal, kills bacteria, and serves as a barrier to trap foreign particles (dust, fungal spores,
etc.) by coating the guard hairs of the ear, making them sticky.[1]
These glands are capable of developing both benign and malignant tumors. The benign tumors include
ceruminous adenoma, ceruminous pleomorphic adenoma, and ceruminous syringocystadenoma
papilliferum. The malignant tumors include ceruminous adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and
mucoepidermoid carcinoma.[2]
