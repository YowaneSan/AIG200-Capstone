Prostate
The prostate (/ˈprɒs.teɪt/)[1] is both an accessory gland
of the male reproductive system and a muscle-driven
mechanical switch between urination and ejaculation. It
is found in all male mammals.[2] It differs between
species anatomically, chemically, and physiologically.
Anatomically, the prostate is found below the bladder,
with the urethra passing through it. It is described in
gross anatomy as consisting of lobes and in
microanatomy by zone. It is surrounded by an elastic,
fibromuscular capsule and contains glandular tissue, as
well as connective tissue.
The prostate produces and contains fluid that forms part
of semen, the substance emitted during ejaculation as
part of the male sexual response. This prostatic fluid is
slightly alkaline, milky or white in appearance. The
alkalinity of semen helps neutralize the acidity of the
vaginal tract, prolonging the lifespan of sperm. The
prostatic fluid is expelled in the first part of ejaculate,
together with most of the sperm, because of the action
of smooth muscle tissue within the prostate. In
comparison with the few spermatozoa expelled together
with mainly seminal vesicular fluid, those in prostatic
fluid have better motility, longer survival, and better
protection of genetic material.
Disorders of the prostate include enlargement,
inflammation, infection, and cancer. The word prostate
comes from Ancient Greek προστάτης, prostátēs,
meaning "one who stands before", "protector",
"guardian", with the term originally used to describe the
seminal vesicles.
The prostate is a gland of the male reproductive system.
In adults, it is about the size of a walnut,[3] and has an
average weight of about 11  grams, usually ranging
between 7 and 16 grams.[4] The prostate is located in
the pelvis. It sits below the urinary bladder and
surrounds the urethra. The part of the urethra passing

Anatomical terminology
through it is called the prostatic urethra, which joins
with the two ejaculatory ducts.[3] The prostate is
covered in a surface called the prostatic capsule or
prostatic fascia.[5]
The internal structure of the prostate has been described
using both lobes and zones.[6][3] Because of the
variation in descriptions and definitions of lobes, the zone classification is used more predominantly.[3]
The prostate has been described as consisting of three or four zones.[3][5] Zones are more typically able to
be seen on histology, or in medical imaging, such as ultrasound or MRI.[3][6] The zones are:
Name
Fraction of

gland[3]
Description
Peripheral zone
(PZ)
70%
The back of the gland that surrounds the distal urethra and lies beneath the
capsule. About 70–80% of prostatic cancers originate from this zone of the
gland.[7][8]
Central zone (CZ)
20%
This zone surrounds the ejaculatory ducts.[3] The central zone accounts for
roughly 2.5% of prostate cancers; these cancers tend to be more
aggressive and more likely to invade the seminal vesicles.[9]
Transition zone
(TZ)
5%
The transition zone surrounds the proximal urethra.[3] ~10–20% of prostate
cancers originate in this zone. It is the region of the prostate gland that
grows throughout life and causes the disease of benign prostatic
enlargement.[7][8]
Anterior fibro-
muscular zone (or
stroma)
N/A
This area, not always considered a zone,[5] is usually devoid of glandular
components and composed only, as its name suggests, of muscle and
fibrous tissue.[3]
The "lobe" classification describes lobes that, while originally defined in the fetus, are also visible in gross
anatomy, including dissection and when viewed endoscopically.[6][5] The five lobes are the anterior lobe or
isthmus, the posterior lobe, the right and left lateral lobes, and the middle or median lobe.
Lobes of prostate
 
Zones of prostate
Inside of the prostate, adjacent and parallel to the prostatic urethra, there are two longitudinal muscle
systems. On the front side (ventrally) runs the urethral dilator (musculus dilatator urethrae), on the
backside (dorsally) runs the muscle switching the urethra into the ejaculatory state (musculus
ejaculatorius).[10]
The prostate receives blood through the inferior vesical artery, internal pudendal artery, and middle rectal
arteries. These vessels enter the prostate on its outer posterior surface where it meets the bladder, and travel
forward to the apex of the prostate.[5] Both the inferior vesical and the middle rectal arteries often arise
together directly from the internal iliac arteries. On entering the bladder, the inferior vesical artery splits into
a urethral branch, supplying the urethral prostate; and a capsular branch, which travels around the capsule
and has smaller branches, which perforate into the prostate.[5]
The veins of the prostate form a network – the prostatic venous plexus, primarily around its front and outer
surface.[5] This network also receives blood from the deep dorsal vein of the penis, and is connected via
branches to the vesical plexus and internal pudendal veins.[5] Veins drain into the vesical and then internal
iliac veins.[5]
The lymphatic drainage of the prostate depends on the positioning of the area. Vessels surrounding the vas
deferens, some of the vessels in the seminal vesicle, and a vessel from the posterior surface of the prostate
drain into the external iliac lymph nodes.[5] Some of the seminal vesicle vessels, prostatic vessels, and
vessels from the anterior prostate drain into internal iliac lymph nodes.[5] Vessels of the prostate itself also
drain into the obturator and sacral lymph nodes.[5]

The prostate consists of glandular and connective tissue.[3] Tall column-shaped cells form the lining (the
epithelium) of the glands.[3] These form one layer or may be pseudostratified.[5] The epithelium is highly
variable and areas of low cuboidal or flat cells can also be present, with transitional epithelium in the outer
regions of the longer ducts.[11] Basal cells surround the luminal epithelial cells in benign glands. The glands

are formed as many follicles, which drain into canals and
subsequently 12–20 main ducts, These in turn drain into the urethra
as it passes through the prostate.[5] There are also a small amount of
flat cells, which sit next to the basement membranes of glands, and
act as stem cells.[3]
The connective tissue of the prostate is made up of fibrous tissue
and smooth muscle.[3] The fibrous tissue separates the gland into
lobules.[3] It also sits between the glands and is composed of
randomly orientated smooth-muscle bundles that are continuous
with the bladder.[12]
Over time, thickened secretions called corpora amylacea accumulate in the gland.[3]

About 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and almost 75% of these genes are
expressed in the normal prostate.[13][14] About 150 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the
prostate, with about 20 genes being highly prostate specific.[15] The corresponding specific proteins are
expressed in the glandular and secretory cells of the prostatic gland and have functions that are important for
the characteristics of semen, including prostate-specific proteins, such as the prostate specific antigen (PSA),
and the prostatic acid phosphatase.[16]
In the developing embryo, at the hind end lies an inpouching called the cloaca. This, over the fourth to the
seventh week, divides into a urogenital sinus and the beginnings of the anal canal, with a wall forming
between these two inpouchings called the urorectal septum.[17] The urogenital sinus divides into three parts,
with the middle part forming the urethra; the upper part is largest and becomes the urinary bladder, and the
lower part then changes depending on the biological sex of the embryo.[17]
The prostatic part of the urethra develops from the middle, pelvic, part of the urogenital sinus, which is of
endodermal origin.[18] Around the end of the third month of embryonic life, outgrowths arise from the
prostatic part of the urethra and grow into the surrounding mesenchyme.[18] The cells lining this part of the

urethra differentiate into the glandular epithelium of the prostate.[18] The associated mesenchyme
differentiates into the dense connective tissue and the smooth muscle of the prostate.[19]
Condensation of mesenchyme, urethra, and Wolffian ducts gives rise to the adult prostate gland, a
composite organ made up of several tightly fused glandular and non-glandular components. To function
properly, the prostate needs male hormones (androgens), which are responsible for male sex characteristics.
The main male hormone is testosterone, which is produced mainly by the testicles. It is dihydrotestosterone
(DHT), a metabolite of testosterone, that predominantly regulates the prostate. The prostate gland enlarges
over time, until the fourth decade of life.[5]
The prostate secretes fluid, which becomes part of the semen. Its secretion forms up to 30% of the semen.
Semen is the fluid emitted (ejaculated) by males during the sexual response.[20] When sperm are emitted,
they are transmitted from the vas deferens into the male urethra via the ejaculatory duct, which lies within
the prostate gland.[20] Ejaculation is the expulsion of semen from the urethra.[20] Semen is moved into the
urethra following contractions of the smooth muscle of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles, following
stimulation, primarily of the glans penis. Stimulation sends nerve signals via the internal pudendal nerves to
the upper lumbar spine; the nerve signals causing contraction act via the hypogastric nerves.[20] After
traveling into the urethra, the seminal fluid is ejaculated by contraction of the bulbocavernosus muscle.[20]
The secretions of the prostate include proteolytic enzymes, prostatic acid phosphatase, fibrinolysin, zinc,
and prostate-specific antigen.[5] Together with the secretions from the seminal vesicles, these form the major
fluid part of semen.[5]
The prostate's changes of shape, which facilitate the mechanical switch between urination and ejaculation,
are mainly driven by the two longitudinal muscle systems running along the prostatic urethra. These are the
urethral dilator (musculus dilatator urethrae) on the urethra's front side, which contracts during urination
and thereby shortens and tilts the prostate in its vertical dimension thus widening the prostatic section of the
urethral tube,[21][22] and the muscle switching the urethra into the ejaculatory state (musculus ejaculatorius)
on its backside.[10]
In case of an operation, e.g. because of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), damaging or sparing of these
two muscle systems varies considerably depending on the choice of operation type and details of the
procedure of the chosen technique. The effects on postoperational urination and ejaculation vary
correspondingly.[23]

It is possible for some men to achieve orgasm solely through stimulation of the prostate gland, such as via
prostate massage or anal intercourse.[24][25] This has led to the area of the rectal wall adjacent to the
prostate to be popularly referred by the anatomically incorrect term, the "male G-spot".[26]
Prostatitis is inflammation of the prostate gland. It can be caused by
infection with bacteria, or other noninfective causes. Inflammation
of the prostate can cause painful urination or ejaculation, groin pain,
difficulty passing urine, or constitutional symptoms such as fever or
tiredness.[27] When inflamed, the prostate becomes enlarged and is
tender when touched during digital rectal examination. The bacteria
responsible for the infection may be detected by a urine culture.[27]
Acute prostatitis and chronic bacterial prostatitis are treated with
antibiotics.[27] Chronic non-bacterial prostatitis, or male chronic
pelvic pain syndrome is treated by a large variety of modalities
including the medications alpha blockers, non-steroidal anti-
inflammatories and amitriptyline,[27] antihistamines, and other
anxiolytics.[28] Other treatments that are not medications may
include physical therapy,[29] psychotherapy, nerve modulators, and surgery. More recently, a combination
of trigger point and psychological therapy has proved effective for category III prostatitis as well.[28]
An enlarged prostate is called prostatomegaly, with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) being the most
common cause. BPH refers to an enlargement of the prostate due to an increase in the number of cells that
make up the prostate (hyperplasia) from a cause that is not a malignancy. It is very common in older
men.[27] It is often diagnosed when the prostate has enlarged to the point where urination becomes difficult.
Symptoms include needing to urinate often (urinary frequency) or taking a while to get started (urinary
hesitancy). If the prostate grows too large, it may constrict the urethra and impede the flow of urine, making
urination painful and difficult, or in extreme cases completely impossible, causing urinary retention.[27]
Over time, chronic retention may cause the bladder to become larger and cause a backflow of urine into the
kidneys (hydronephrosis).[27]
BPH can be treated with medication, a minimally invasive procedure or, in extreme cases, surgery that
removes the prostate. In general, treatment often begins with an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist
medication such as tamsulosin, which reduces the tone of the smooth muscle found in the urethra that
passes through the prostate, making it easier for urine to pass through.[27] For people with persistent
symptoms, procedures may be considered. The surgery most often used in such cases is transurethral
resection of the prostate,[27] in which an instrument is inserted through the urethra to remove prostate tissue
that is pressing against the upper part of the urethra and restricting the flow of urine. Minimally invasive

procedures include transurethral needle ablation of the prostate and transurethral microwave
thermotherapy.[30] These outpatient procedures may be followed by the insertion of a temporary stent, to
allow normal voluntary urination, without exacerbating irritative symptoms.[31]
Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting older
men in the UK, US, Northern Europe and Australia, and a
significant cause of death for elderly men worldwide.[32] Often, a
person does not have symptoms; when they do occur, symptoms
may include urinary frequency, urgency, hesitation and other
symptoms associated with BPH. Uncommonly, such cancers may
cause weight loss, retention of urine, or symptoms such as back
pain due to metastatic lesions that have spread outside of the
prostate.[27]
A digital rectal examination and the measurement of a prostate-
specific antigen (PSA) level are usually the first investigations done
to check for prostate cancer. PSA values are difficult to interpret,
because a high value might be present in a person without cancer,
and a low value can be present in someone with cancer.[27] The
next form of testing is often the taking of a prostate biopsy to assess
for tumour activity and invasiveness.[27] Because of the significant
risk of overdiagnosis with widespread screening in the general
population, prostate cancer screening is controversial.[33] If a
tumour is confirmed, medical imaging such as an MRI or bone
scan may be done to check for the presence of tumour metastases
in other parts of the body.[27]
Prostate cancer that is only present in the prostate is often treated
with either surgical removal of the prostate or with radiotherapy or
by the insertion of small radioactive particles of iodine-125 or palladium-103, called brachytherapy.[34][27]
Cancer that has spread to other parts of the body is usually treated also with hormone therapy, to deprive a
tumour of sex hormones (androgens) that stimulate proliferation. This is often done through the use of
GnRH analogues or agents (such as bicalutamide) that block the receptors that androgens act on;
occasionally, surgical removal of the testes may be done instead.[27] Cancer that does not respond to
hormonal treatment, or that progresses after treatment, might be treated with chemotherapy such as
docetaxel. Radiotherapy may also be used to help with pain associated with bony lesions.[27]
Sometimes, the decision may be made not to treat prostate cancer. If a cancer is small and localised, the
decision may be made to monitor for cancer activity at intervals ("active surveillance") and defer
treatment.[27] If a person, because of frailty or other medical conditions or reasons, has a life expectancy
less than ten years, then the impacts of treatment may outweigh any perceived benefits.[27]
Cancer
Surgery
Surgery to remove the prostate is called prostatectomy, and is usually done as a treatment for cancer limited
to the prostate, or prostatic enlargement.[35] When it is done, it may be done as open surgery or as
laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery.[35] These are done under general anaesthetic.[36] Usually the procedure for
cancer is a radical prostatectomy, which means that the seminal vesicles are removed and the vasa deferentia
are also tied off.[35] Part of the prostate can also be removed from within the urethra, called transurethral
resection of the prostate (TURP).[35] Open surgery may involve a cut that is made in the perineum, or via
an approach that involves a cut down the midline from the belly button to the pubic bone.[35] Open surgery
may be preferred if there is a suspicion that lymph nodes are involved and they need to be removed or
biopsied during a procedure.[35] A perineal approach will not involve lymph node removal and may result
in less pain and a faster recovery following an operation.[35] A TURP procedure uses a tube inserted into
the urethra via the penis and some form of heat, electricity or laser to remove prostate tissue.[35]
The whole prostate can be removed. Complications that might develop because of surgery include urinary
incontinence and erectile dysfunction because of damage to nerves during the operation, particularly if a
cancer is very close to nerves.[35][36] Ejaculation of semen will not occur during orgasm if the vasa
deferentia are tied off and seminal vesicles removed, such as during a radical prosatectomy.[35] This will
mean a man becomes infertile.[35] Sometimes, orgasm may not be able to occur or may be painful. The
penis length may change if the part of the urethra within the prostate is also removed.[35] General
complications due to surgery can also develop, such as infections, bleeding, inadvertent damage to nearby
organs or within the abdomen, and the formation of blood clots.[35]
The prostate was first formally identified by Venetian anatomist Niccolò Massa in Anatomiae libri
introductorius (Introduction to Anatomy) 1536 and illustrated by Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius in
Tabulae anatomicae sex (six anatomical tables) in 1538.[37][6] Massa described it as a "glandular flesh upon
which rests the neck of the bladder," and Vesalius as a "glandular body".[38] The first time a word similar to
'prostate' was used to describe the gland is credited to André du Laurens in 1600, who described it as a term
already in use by anatomists at the time.[38][6] The term was however used at least as early as 1549 by
French surgeon Ambroise Pare.[6]
At the time, Du Laurens was describing what was considered to be a pair of organs (not the single two-
lobed organ), and the Latin term prostatae that was used was a mistranslation of the term for the Ancient
Greek word used to describe the seminal vesicles, parastatai;[38] although it has been argued that surgeons
in Ancient Greece and Rome must have at least seen the prostate as an anatomical entity.[6] The term
prostatae was taken rather than the grammatically correct prostator (singular) and prostatores (plural)
because the gender of the Ancient Greek term was taken as female, when it was in fact male.[38]
The fact that the prostate was one and not two organs was an idea popularised throughout the early 18th
century, as was the English language term used to describe the organ, prostate,[38] attributed to William
Cheselden.[39] A monograph, "Practical observations on the treatment of the diseases of the prostate gland"
by Everard Home in 1811, was important in the history of the prostate by describing and naming anatomical
parts of the prostate, including the median lobe.[38] The idea of the five lobes of the prostate was
popularized following anatomical studies conducted by American urologist Oswald Lowsley in 1912.[6][39]
John E. McNeal first proposed the idea of "zones" in 1968; McNeal found that the relatively homogeneous
cut surface of an adult prostate in no way resembled "lobes" and thus led to the description of "zones".[40]
History
Prostate cancer was first described in a speech to the Medical and Chiurgical Society of London in 1853 by
surgeon John Adams[41][42] and increasingly described by the late 19th century.[43] Prostate cancer was
initially considered a rare disease, probably because of shorter life expectancies and poorer detection
methods in the 19th century. The first treatments of prostate cancer were surgeries to relieve urinary
obstruction.[44] Samuel David Gross has been credited with the first mention of a prostatectomy, as "too
absurd to be seriously entertained"[45][43] The first removal for prostate cancer (radical perineal
prostatectomy) was first performed in 1904 by Hugh H. Young at Johns Hopkins Hospital;[46][43] partial
removal of the gland was conducted by Theodore Billroth in 1867.[39]
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) replaced radical prostatectomy for symptomatic relief of
obstruction in the middle of the 20th century because it could better preserve penile erectile function.
Radical retropubic prostatectomy was developed in 1983 by Patrick Walsh.[47] In 1941, Charles B.
Huggins published studies in which he used estrogen to oppose testosterone production in men with
metastatic prostate cancer. This discovery of "chemical castration" won Huggins the 1966 Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine.[48]
The role of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in reproduction was determined by Andrzej W.
Schally and Roger Guillemin, who both won the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this
work. GnRH receptor agonists, such as leuprorelin and goserelin, were subsequently developed and used to
treat prostate cancer.[49][50] Radiation therapy for prostate cancer was first developed in the early 20th
century and initially consisted of intraprostatic radium implants. External beam radiotherapy became more
popular as stronger X-ray radiation sources became available in the middle of the 20th century.
Brachytherapy with implanted seeds (for prostate cancer) was first described in 1983.[51] Systemic
chemotherapy for prostate cancer was first studied in the 1970s. The initial regimen of cyclophosphamide
and 5-fluorouracil was quickly joined by multiple regimens using a host of other systemic chemotherapy
drugs.[52]
The prostate is found only in mammals.[53] The prostate glands of male marsupials are proportionally larger
than those of placental mammals.[54] The presence of a functional prostate in monotremes is controversial,
and if monotremes do possess functional prostates, they may not make the same contribution to semen as in
other mammals.[55]
The structure of the prostate varies, ranging from tubuloalveolar (as in humans) to branched tubular. The
gland is particularly well developed in dogs, foxes and boars, though in other mammals, such as bulls, it can
be small and inconspicuous.[56][57][58] In other animals, such as marsupials[59][60] and small ruminants, the
prostate is disseminate, meaning not specifically localisable as a distinct tissue, but present throughout the
relevant part of the urethra; in other animals, such as red deer and American elk, it may be present as a
specific organ and in a disseminate form.[61] In some marsupial species, the size of the prostate gland
changes seasonally.[62] The prostate is the only accessory gland that occurs in male dogs.[63] Dogs can
produce in one hour as much prostatic fluid as a human can in a day. They excrete this fluid along with their
urine to mark their territory.[64] Additionally, dogs are the only species apart from humans seen to have a
significant incidence of prostate cancer.[65] The prostate is the only male accessory gland that occurs in
cetaceans,[66] consisting of diffuse urethral glands[67] surrounded by a very powerful compressor
muscle.[68]
Other animals
The prostate gland originates with tissues in the urethral wall. This means the urethra, a compressible tube
used for urination, runs through the middle of the prostate; enlargement of the prostate can constrict the
urethra so that urinating becomes slow and painful.[69]
Prostatic secretions vary among species. They are generally composed of simple sugars and are often
slightly alkaline.[70] In eutherian mammals, these secretions usually contain fructose. The prostatic
secretions of marsupials usually contain n-Acetylglucosamine or glycogen instead of fructose.[71]
Because the Skene's gland and the male prostate act similarly by secreting prostate-specific antigen (PSA),
which is an ejaculate protein produced in males, and of prostate-specific acid phosphatase, the Skene's
gland is sometimes referred to as the "female prostate".[72][73] Although homologous to the male prostate
(developed from the same embryological tissues),[74][75] various aspects of its development in relation to
the male prostate are widely unknown and a matter of research.[76]
