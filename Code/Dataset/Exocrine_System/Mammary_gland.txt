Mammary gland
A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in humans and other
mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals
get their name from the Latin word mamma, "breast". The
mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in
primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in
ruminants (for example, cows, goats, sheep, and deer), and the
dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea,
the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in
any mammal, but in most mammals, lactation, the production of
enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females
who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by
hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian
species, male lactation can occur. With humans, male lactation
can occur only under specific circumstances.
Mammals 
are 
divided 
into 
3 
groups: 
prototherians,
metatherians, and eutherians. In the case of prototherians, both
males and females have functional mammary glands, but their
mammary glands are without nipples. These mammary glands
are modified sebaceous glands. Concerning metatherians and
eutherians, only females have functional mammary glands.
Their mammary glands can be termed as breasts or udders. In
the case of breasts, each mammary gland has its own nipple
(e.g., human mammary glands). In the case of udders, pairs of
mammary glands comprise a single mass, with more than one
nipple (or teat) hanging from it. For instance, cows and buffalo
udders have two pairs of mammary glands and four teats,
whereas sheep and goat udders have one pair of mammary
glands with two teats protruding from the udder. Each gland
produces milk for a single teat. These mammary glands are
modified sweat glands.
The basic components of a mature mammary gland are the
alveoli (hollow cavities, a few millimeters large), which are
lined with milk-secreting cuboidal cells and surrounded by
myoepithelial cells. These alveoli join to form groups known as
lobules. Each lobule has a lactiferous duct that drains into
openings in the nipple. The myoepithelial cells contract under
the stimulation of oxytocin, excreting the milk secreted by

alveolar units into the lobule lumen toward the nipple. As the
infant begins to suck, the oxytocin-mediated "let down reflex"
ensues, and the mother's milk is secreted — not sucked — from
the gland into the baby's mouth.[4]
All the milk-secreting tissue leading to a single lactiferous duct
is collectively called a "simple mammary gland"; in a "complex
mammary gland", all the simple mammary glands serve one
nipple. Humans normally have two complex mammary glands,
one in each breast, and each complex mammary gland consists
of 10–20 simple glands. The opening of each simple gland on
the surface of the nipple is called a "pore."[5] The presence of
more than two nipples is known as polythelia and the presence
of more than two complex mammary glands as polymastia.
Maintaining the correct polarized morphology of the lactiferous
duct tree requires another essential component – mammary
epithelial cells extracellular matrix (ECM) which, together with
adipocytes, fibroblast, inflammatory cells, and others, constitute
mammary stroma.[6] Mammary epithelial ECM mainly contains
myoepithelial basement membrane and the connective tissue.
They not only help to support mammary basic structure, but also serve as a communicating bridge between
mammary epithelia and their local and global environment throughout this organ's development.[7][8]
A mammary gland is a specific type of apocrine gland specialized
for manufacture of colostrum (first milk) when giving birth.
Mammary glands can be identified as apocrine because they exhibit
striking "decapitation" secretion. Many sources assert that
mammary glands are modified sweat glands.[9][10][11]
Mammary glands develop during different growth cycles. They
exist in both sexes during the embryonic stage, forming only a
rudimentary duct tree at birth. In this stage, mammary gland
development depends on systemic (and maternal) hormones,[6] but
is also under the (local) regulation of paracrine communication between neighboring epithelial and
mesenchymal cells by parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP).[12] This locally secreted factor gives
rise to a series of outside-in and inside-out positive feedback between these two types of cells, so that
mammary bud epithelial cells can proliferate and sprout down into the mesenchymal layer until they reach
the fat pad to begin the first round of branching.[6] At the same time, the embryonic mesenchymal cells
around the epithelial bud receive secreting factors activated by PTHrP, such as BMP4. These mesenchymal
cells can transform into a dense, mammary-specific mesenchyme, which later develop into connective tissue
with fibrous threads, forming blood vessels and the lymph system.[13] A basement membrane, mainly

containing laminin and collagen, formed afterward by differentiated
myoepithelial cells, keeps the polarity of this primary duct tree. These
components of the extracellular matrix are strong determinants of duct
morphogenesis.[14]
Estrogen and growth hormone (GH) are essential for the ductal component
of mammary gland development, and act synergistically to mediate
it.[15][16][17][18][19] Neither estrogen nor GH are capable of inducing ductal
development without the other.[16][17][18][19] The role of GH in ductal
development has been found to be mostly mediated by its induction of the
secretion of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which occurs both
systemically (mainly originating from the liver) and locally in the mammary
fat pad through activation of the growth hormone receptor (GHR).[16][17][18][19][20] However, GH itself
also acts independently of IGF-1 to stimulate ductal development by upregulating estrogen receptor (ER)
expression in mammary gland tissue, which is a downstream effect of mammary gland GHR activation.[19]
In any case, unlike IGF-1, GH itself is not essential for mammary gland development, and IGF-1 in
conjunction with estrogen can induce normal mammary gland development without the presence of GH.[19]
In addition to IGF-1, other paracrine growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming
growth factor beta (TGF-β),[21] amphiregulin,[22] fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF)[23] are involved in breast development as mediators downstream to sex hormones and
GH/IGF-1.[24][25][26]
During embryonic development, IGF-1 levels are low, and gradually increase from birth to puberty.[27] At
puberty, the levels of GH and IGF-1 reach their highest levels in life and estrogen begins to be secreted in
high amounts in females, which is when ductal development mostly takes place.[27] Under the influence of
estrogen, stromal and fat tissue surrounding the ductal system in the mammary glands also grows.[28] After
puberty, GH and IGF-1 levels progressively decrease, which limits further development until pregnancy, if
it occurs.[27] During pregnancy, progesterone and prolactin are essential for mediating lobuloalveolar
development in estrogen-primed mammary gland tissue, which occurs in preparation of lactation and
nursing.[15][29]
Androgens such as testosterone inhibit estrogen-mediated mammary gland development (e.g., by reducing
local ER expression) through activation of androgen receptors expressed in mammary gland tissue,[29][30]
and in conjunction with relatively low estrogen levels, are the cause of the lack of developed mammary
glands in males.[31]
Mammary gland development is characterized by the unique process by which the epithelium invades the
stroma. The development of the mammary gland occurs mainly after birth. During puberty, tubule formation
is coupled with branching morphogenesis which establishes the basic arboreal network of ducts emanating
from the nipple.[32]
Biochemistry
Timeline
Before birth
Developmentally, mammary gland epithelium is constantly produced and maintained by rare epithelial cells,
dubbed as mammary progenitors which are ultimately thought to be derived from tissue-resident stem
cells.[33]
Embryonic mammary gland development can be divided into a series of specific stages. Initially, the
formation of the milk lines that run between the fore and hind limbs bilaterally on each side of the midline
occurs around embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). The second stage occurs at E11.5 when placode formation
begins along the mammary milk line. This will eventually give rise to the nipple. Lastly, the third stage
occurs at E12.5 and involves the invagination of cells within the placode into the mesenchyme, leading to a
mammary anlage (biology).[34]
The primitive (stem) cells are detected in embryo and their numbers increase steadily during
development[35]
Postnatally, the mammary ducts elongate into the mammary fat pad. Then, starting around four weeks of
age, mammary ductal growth increases significantly with the ducts invading towards the lymph node.
Terminal end buds, the highly proliferative structures found at the tips of the invading ducts, expand and
increase greatly during this stage. This developmental period is characterized by the emergence of the
terminal end buds and lasts until an age of about 7–8 weeks.
By the pubertal stage, the mammary ducts have invaded to the end of the mammary fat pad. At this point,
the terminal end buds become less proliferative and decrease in size. Side branches form from the primary
ducts and begin to fill the mammary fat pad. Ductal development decreases with the arrival of sexual
maturity and undergoes estrous cycles (proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus). As a result of estrous
cycling, the mammary gland undergoes dynamic changes where cells proliferate and then regress in an
ordered fashion.[36]
During pregnancy, the ductal systems undergo rapid proliferation and form alveolar structures within the
branches to be used for milk production. After delivery, lactation occurs within the mammary gland;
lactation involves the secretion of milk by the luminal cells in the alveoli. Contraction of the myoepithelial
cells surrounding the alveoli will cause the milk to be ejected through the ducts and into the nipple for the
nursing infant. Upon weaning of the infant, lactation stops and the mammary gland turns in on itself, a
process called involution. This process involves the controlled collapse of mammary epithelial cells where
cells begin apoptosis in a controlled manner, reverting the mammary gland back to a pubertal state.
During postmenopause, due to much lower levels of estrogen, and due to lower levels of GH and IGF-1,
which decrease with age, mammary gland tissue atrophies and the mammary glands become smaller.

Physiology
Hormonal control
Lactiferous duct development occurs in females in response to circulating hormones. First development is
frequently seen during pre- and postnatal stages, and later during puberty. Estrogen promotes branching
differentiation,[37] whereas in males testosterone inhibits it. A mature duct tree reaching the limit of the fat
pad of the mammary gland comes into being by bifurcation of duct terminal end buds (TEB), secondary
branches sprouting from primary ducts[7][38] and proper duct lumen formation. These processes are tightly
modulated by components of mammary epithelial ECM interacting with systemic hormones and local
secreting factors. However, for each mechanism the epithelial cells' "niche" can be delicately unique with
different membrane receptor profiles and basement membrane thickness from specific branching area to
area, so as to regulate cell growth or differentiation sub-locally.[39] Important players include beta-1
integrin, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), laminin-1/5, collagen-IV, matrix metalloproteinase
(MMPs), heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and others. Elevated circulating level of growth hormone and
estrogen get to multipotent cap cells on TEB tips through a thin, leaky layer of basement membrane. These
hormones promote specific gene expression. Hence cap cells can differentiate into myoepithelial and
luminal (duct) epithelial cells, and the increased amount of activated MMPs can degrade surrounding ECM
helping duct buds to reach further in the fat pads.[40][41] On the other hand, basement membrane along the
mature mammary ducts is thicker, with strong adhesion to epithelial cells via binding to integrin and non-
integrin receptors. When side branches develop, it is a much more "pushing-forward" working process
including extending through myoepithelial cells, degrading basement membrane and then invading into a
periductal layer of fibrous stromal tissue.[7] Degraded basement membrane fragments (laminin-5) roles to
lead the way of mammary epithelial cells migration.[42] Whereas, laminin-1 interacts with non-integrin
receptor dystroglycan negatively regulates this side branching process in case of cancer.[43] These complex
"Yin-yang" balancing crosstalks between mammary ECM and epithelial cells "instruct" healthy mammary
gland development until adult.
There is preliminary evidence that soybean intake mildly stimulates the breast glands in pre- and
postmenopausal women.[44]
Secretory alveoli develop mainly in pregnancy, when rising levels of prolactin, estrogen, and progesterone
cause further branching, together with an increase in adipose tissue and a richer blood flow. In gestation,
serum progesterone remains at a stably high concentration so signaling through its receptor is continuously
activated. As one of the transcribed genes, Wnts secreted from mammary epithelial cells act paracrinely to
induce more neighboring cells' branching.[45][46] When the lactiferous duct tree is almost ready, "leaves"
alveoli are differentiated from luminal epithelial cells and added at the end of each branch. In late pregnancy
and for the first few days after giving birth, colostrum is secreted. Milk secretion (lactation) begins a few
days later due to reduction in circulating progesterone and the presence of another important hormone
prolactin, which mediates further alveologenesis, milk protein production, and regulates osmotic balance
and tight junction function. Laminin and collagen in myoepithelial basement membrane interacting with
beta-1 integrin on epithelial surface again, is essential in this process.[47][48] Their binding ensures correct
placement of prolactin receptors on the basal lateral side of alveoli cells and directional secretion of milk
into lactiferous ducts.[47][48] Suckling of the baby causes release of the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates
contraction of the myoepithelial cells. In this combined control from ECM and systemic hormones, milk
secretion can be reciprocally amplified so as to provide enough nutrition for the baby.
Pregnancy
Weaning
During weaning, decreased prolactin, missing mechanical stimulation (baby suckling), and changes in
osmotic balance caused by milk stasis and leaking of tight junctions cause cessation of milk production. It is
the (passive) process of a child or animal ceasing to be dependent on the mother for nourishment. In some
species there is complete or partial involution of alveolar structures after weaning, in humans there is only
partial involution and the level of involution in humans appears to be highly individual. The glands in the
breast do secrete fluid also in nonlactating women.[49] In some other species (such as cows), all alveoli and
secretory duct structures collapse by programmed cell death (apoptosis) and autophagy for lack of growth
promoting factors either from the ECM or circulating hormones.[50][51] At the same time, apoptosis of
blood capillary endothelial cells speeds up the regression of lactation ductal beds. Shrinkage of the
mammary duct tree and ECM remodeling by various proteinase is under the control of somatostatin and
other growth inhibiting hormones and local factors.[52] This major structural change leads loose fat tissue to
fill the empty space afterward. But a functional lactiferous duct tree can be formed again when a female is
pregnant again.
Tumorigenesis in mammary glands can be induced biochemically by abnormal expression level of
circulating hormones or local ECM components,[53] or from a mechanical change in the tension of
mammary stroma.[54] Under either of the two circumstances, mammary epithelial cells would grow out of
control and eventually result in cancer. Almost all instances of breast cancer originate in the lobules or ducts
of the mammary glands.
The breasts of female humans vary from most other mammals that tend to have less conspicuous mammary
glands. The number and positioning of mammary glands varies widely in different mammals. The
protruding teats and accompanying glands can be located anywhere along the two milk lines. In general
most mammals develop mammary glands in pairs along these lines, with a number approximating the
number of young typically birthed at a time. The number of teats varies from 2 (in most primates) to 18 (in
pigs). The Virginia opossum has 13, one of the few mammals with an odd number.[55][56] The following
table lists the number and position of teats and glands found in a range of mammals:

Male mammals typically have rudimentary mammary glands and nipples, with a few exceptions: male mice
do not have nipples,[60] male marsupials do not have mammary glands,[61] and male horses lack
nipples.[62] The male dayak fruit bat has lactating mammary glands.[63] Male lactation occurs infrequently
in some species.[64]
Mammary glands are true protein factories,[65] and several labs have constructed transgenic animals, mainly
goats and cows, to produce proteins for pharmaceutical use.[66] Complex glycoproteins such as monoclonal
antibodies or antithrombin cannot be produced by genetically engineered bacteria, and the production in
live mammals is much cheaper than the use of mammalian cell cultures.
There are many theories on how mammary glands evolved. For example, it is thought that the mammary
gland is a transformed sweat gland, more closely related to apocrine sweat glands.[67] Because mammary
glands do not fossilize well, supporting such theories with fossil evidence is difficult. Many of the current
theories are based on comparisons between lines of living mammals—monotremes, marsupials, and
eutherians. One theory proposes that mammary glands evolved from glands that were used to keep the eggs
of early mammals moist[68][69] and free from infection[70][71] (monotremes still lay eggs). Other theories
suggest that early secretions were used directly by hatched young,[72] or that the secretions were used by
young to help them orient to their mothers.[73]
Evolution
Lactation is thought to have developed long before the evolution of the mammary gland and mammals; see
