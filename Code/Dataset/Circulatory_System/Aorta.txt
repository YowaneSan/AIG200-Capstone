Aorta
The aorta (/eɪˈɔːrtə/ ay-OR-tə; pl.: aortas or aortae) is the
main and largest artery in the human body, originating from
the left ventricle of the heart, branching upwards immediately
after, and extending down to the abdomen, where it splits at
the aortic bifurcation into two smaller arteries (the common
iliac arteries). The aorta distributes oxygenated blood to all
parts of the body through the systemic circulation.[1]
In anatomical sources, the aorta is usually divided into
sections.[2][3][4][5]
One way of classifying a part of the aorta is by anatomical
compartment, where the thoracic aorta (or thoracic portion of
the aorta) runs from the heart to the diaphragm. The aorta
then continues downward as the abdominal aorta (or
abdominal portion of the aorta) from the diaphragm to the
aortic bifurcation.
Another system divides the aorta with respect to its course
and the direction of blood flow. In this system, the aorta starts
as the ascending aorta, travels superiorly from the heart, and
then makes a hairpin turn known as the aortic arch.
Following the aortic arch, the aorta then travels inferiorly as
the descending aorta. The descending aorta has two parts.
The aorta begins to descend in the thoracic cavity and is
consequently known as the thoracic aorta. After the aorta
passes through the diaphragm, it is known as the abdominal
aorta. The aorta ends by dividing into two major blood
vessels, the common iliac arteries and a smaller midline
vessel, the median sacral artery.[6]: 
18 
The ascending aorta begins at the opening of the aortic valve
in the left ventricle of the heart. It runs through a common
pericardial sheath with the pulmonary trunk. These two
blood vessels twist around each other, causing the aorta to

204  The transition from
ascending aorta to aortic arch is at the pericardial reflection
on the aorta.[8]: 
Plate 211 
At the root of the ascending aorta, the lumen has small
pockets between the cusps of the aortic valve and the wall of
the aorta, which are called the aortic sinuses or the sinuses of
Valsalva. The left aortic sinus contains the origin of the left
coronary artery and the right aortic sinus likewise gives rise
to the right coronary artery. Together, these two arteries
supply the heart. The posterior aortic sinus does not give rise
to a coronary artery. For this reason the left, right and
posterior aortic sinuses are also called left-coronary, right-
coronary and non-coronary sinuses.[7]: 
191 
The aortic arch loops over the left pulmonary artery and the
bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk, to which it remains
connected by the ligamentum arteriosum, a remnant of the
fetal circulation that is obliterated a few days after birth. In
addition to these blood vessels, the aortic arch crosses the left
main bronchus. Between the aortic arch and the pulmonary
trunk is a network of autonomic nerve fibers, the cardiac
plexus or aortic plexus. The left vagus nerve, which passes
anterior to the aortic arch, gives off a major branch, the
recurrent laryngeal nerve, which loops under the aortic arch
just lateral to the ligamentum arteriosum. It then runs back to
the neck.
The aortic arch has three major branches: from proximal to
distal, they are the brachiocephalic trunk, the left common
carotid artery, and the left subclavian artery. The
brachiocephalic trunk supplies the right side of the head and
neck as well as the right arm and chest wall, while the latter
two together supply the left side of the same regions.
The aortic arch ends, and the descending aorta begins at the
level of the intervertebral disc between the fourth and fifth
thoracic vertebrae.[7]:

The thoracic aorta gives rise to the intercostal and subcostal
arteries, as well as to the superior and inferior left bronchial
arteries and variable branches to the esophagus, mediastinum,

and pericardium. Its lowest pair of branches are the superior
phrenic arteries, which supply the diaphragm, and the
subcostal arteries for the twelfth rib.[9]: 
195 
The abdominal aorta begins at the aortic hiatus of the
diaphragm at the level of the twelfth thoracic vertebra.[10] It
gives rise to lumbar and musculophrenic arteries, renal and
middle suprarenal arteries, and visceral arteries (the celiac
trunk, the superior mesenteric artery and the inferior
mesenteric artery). It ends in a bifurcation into the left and
right common iliac arteries. At the point of the bifurcation,
there also springs a smaller branch, the median sacral
artery.[9]: 
331 
The ascending aorta develops from the outflow tract, which
initially starts as a single tube connecting the heart with the
aortic arches (which will form the great arteries) in early
development but is then separated into the aorta and the
pulmonary trunk.
The aortic arches start as five pairs of symmetrical arteries
connecting the heart with the dorsal aorta, and then undergo
a significant remodelling[11] to form the final asymmetrical
structure of the great arteries, with the 3rd pair of arteries
contributing to the common carotids, the right 4th forming
the base and middle part of the right subclavian artery and the
left 4th being the central part of the aortic arch. The smooth
muscle of the great arteries and the population of cells that
form the aorticopulmonary septum that separates the aorta
and pulmonary artery is derived from cardiac neural crest.
This contribution of the neural crest to the great artery
smooth muscle is unusual as most smooth muscle is derived
from mesoderm. In fact the smooth muscle within the
abdominal aorta is derived from mesoderm, and the coronary
arteries, which arise just above the semilunar valves, possess
smooth muscle of mesodermal origin. A failure of the
aorticopulmonary septum to divide the great vessels results in
persistent truncus arteriosus.

Development
Microanatomy
Course of the aorta in the thorax (anterior
view), starting posterior to the main
pulmonary artery, then anterior to the right
pulmonary arteries, the trachea and the
esophagus, then turning posteriorly to
course dorsally to these structures.
A pig's aorta cut open, also showing some
branching arteries.
The aorta is an elastic artery, and as such is quite distensible.
The aorta consists of a heterogeneous mixture of smooth
muscle, nerves, intimal cells, endothelial cells, fibroblast-like
cells, and a complex extracellular matrix. The vascular wall is
subdivided into three layers known as the tunica externa,
tunica media, and tunica intima. The aorta is covered by an
extensive network of tiny blood vessels called vasa vasorum,
which feed the tunica externa and tunica media, the outer
layers of the aorta.[12] The aortic arch contains baroreceptors
and chemoreceptors that relay information concerning blood
pressure and blood pH and carbon dioxide levels to the
medulla oblongata of the brain. This information along with
information from baroreceptors and chemoreceptors located
elsewhere is processed by the brain and the autonomic nervous
system mediates appropriate homeostatic responses.
Within the tunica media, smooth muscle and the extracellular
matrix are quantitatively the largest components, these are
arranged concentrically as musculoelastic layers (the elastic
lamella) in mammals. The elastic lamella, which comprise
smooth muscle and elastic matrix, can be considered as the
fundamental structural unit of the aorta and consist of elastic
fibers, collagens (predominately type III), proteoglycans, and
glycoaminoglycans.[13] The elastic matrix dominates the
biomechanical properties of the aorta. The smooth muscle
component, while contractile, does not substantially alter the
diameter of the aorta,[14] but rather serves to increase the
stiffness and viscoelasticity of the aortic wall when activated.
Variations may occur in the location of the aorta, and the way in which arteries branch off the aorta. The
aorta, normally on the left side of the body, may be found on the right in dextrocardia, in which the heart is
found on the right, or situs inversus, in which the location of all organs are flipped.[9]: 
188 
Variations in the branching of individual arteries may also occur. For example, the left vertebral artery may
arise from the aorta, instead of the left common carotid artery.[9]: 
188 
In patent ductus arteriosus, a congenital disorder, the fetal ductus arteriosus fails to close, leaving an open
vessel connecting the pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta.[15]
The aorta supplies all of the systemic circulation, which means that the entire body, except for the
respiratory zone of the lung, receives its blood from the aorta. Broadly speaking, branches from the
ascending aorta supply the heart; branches from the aortic arch supply the head, neck, and arms; branches

Function
Major aorta anatomy displaying
ascending aorta, brachiocephalic
trunk, left common carotid artery, left
subclavian artery, aortic isthmus,
aortic arch, and descending thoracic
aorta
from the thoracic descending aorta supply the chest (excluding the
heart and the respiratory zone of the lung); and branches from the
abdominal aorta supply the abdomen. The pelvis and legs get their
blood from the common iliac arteries.
The contraction of the heart during systole is responsible for
ejection and creates a (pulse) wave that is propagated down the
aorta, into the arterial tree. The wave is reflected at sites of
impedance mismatching, such as bifurcations, where reflected
waves rebound to return to semilunar valves and the origin of the
aorta. These return waves create the dicrotic notch displayed in the
aortic pressure curve during the cardiac cycle as these reflected
waves push on the aortic semilunar valve.[16] With age, the aorta
stiffens such that the pulse wave is propagated faster and reflected
waves return to the heart faster before the semilunar valve closes,
which raises the blood pressure. The stiffness of the aorta is
associated with a number of diseases and pathologies, and
noninvasive measures of the pulse wave velocity are an
independent indicator of hypertension. Measuring the pulse wave
velocity (invasively and non-invasively) is a means of determining
arterial stiffness. Maximum aortic velocity may be noted as Vmax or less commonly as AoVmax.
Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is highest in the aorta, and the MAP decreases across the circulation from
aorta to arteries to arterioles to capillaries to veins back to atrium. The difference between aortic and right
atrial pressure accounts for blood flow in the circulation.[17] When the left ventricle contracts to force blood
into the aorta, the aorta expands. This stretching gives the potential energy that will help maintain blood
pressure during diastole, as during this time the aorta contracts passively. This Windkessel effect of the great
elastic arteries has important biomechanical implications. The elastic recoil helps conserve the energy from
the pumping heart and smooth out the pulsatile nature created by the heart. Aortic pressure is highest at the
aorta and becomes less pulsatile and lower pressure as blood vessels divide into arteries, arterioles, and
capillaries such that flow is slow and smooth for gases and nutrient exchange.
Central aortic blood pressure has frequently been shown to have greater prognostic value and to show a
more accurate response to antihypertensive drugs than has peripheral blood pressure.[18][19][20]

All amniotes have a broadly similar arrangement to that of humans, albeit with a number of individual
variations. In fish, however, there are two separate vessels referred to as aortas. The ventral aorta carries
de-oxygenated blood from the heart to the gills; part of this vessel forms the ascending aorta in tetrapods
(the remainder forms the pulmonary artery). A second, dorsal aorta carries oxygenated blood from the gills
to the rest of the body and is homologous with the descending aorta of tetrapods. The two aortas are
connected by a number of vessels, one passing through each of the gills. Amphibians also retain the fifth
connecting vessel, so that the aorta has two parallel arches.[23]
The word aorta stems from the Late Latin aorta from Classical Greek aortē (ἀορτή), from aeirō, "I lift,
raise" (ἀείρω)[24] This term was first applied by Aristotle when describing the aorta and describes
accurately how it seems to be "suspended" above the heart.[25]
The function of the aorta is documented in the Talmud, where it is noted as one of three major vessels
entering or leaving the heart, and where perforation is linked to death.[26]
