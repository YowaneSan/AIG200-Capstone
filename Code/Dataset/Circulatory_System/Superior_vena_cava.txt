Superior vena cava
The superior vena cava drains from the
left and right brachiocephalic veins into
the right atrium
Details
Superior vena cava
The superior vena cava (SVC) is the superior of the two
venae cavae, the great venous trunks that return deoxygenated
blood from the systemic circulation to the right atrium of the
heart. It is a large-diameter (24  mm) short length vein that
receives venous return from the upper half of the body, above
the diaphragm. Venous return from the lower half, below the
diaphragm, flows through the inferior vena cava. The SVC is
located in the anterior right superior mediastinum.[1] It is the
typical site of central venous access via a central venous
catheter or a peripherally inserted central catheter. Mentions of
"the cava" without further specification usually refer to the
SVC.
The superior vena cava is formed by the left and right
brachiocephalic veins, which receive blood from the upper
limbs, head and neck, behind the lower border of the first right
costal cartilage. It passes vertically downwards behind the first
intercostal space and receives the azygos vein just before it
pierces the fibrous pericardium opposite the right second costal
cartilage and its lower part is intrapericardial. It then terminates
in the upper and posterior part of the sinus venarum of the right
atrium, at the upper right front portion of the heart. It is also
known as the cranial vena cava in other animals. No valve
divides the superior vena cava from the right atrium.
The superior vena cava is made up of three layers, starting with
the innermost endothelial tunica intima. The middle layer is the
tunica media, composed of smooth muscle tissue, and the
outermost and thickest layer is the tunica adventitia, composed
of collagen and elastic connective tissue that allow for
flexibility. [2][3] The tunica adventitia contains three zones, with
the middle zone consisting of few smooth muscle fibers; this
differs from the longitudinal bundles of smooth muscle found in
the same zone of the inferior vena cava. [4]

Anatomical terminology
The most common anatomical variation is a persistent left
superior  vena cava. In persons with a persistent left
superior vena cava, the right superior vena cava may be normal,
small or absent, with or without an anterior communicating
vein. This variation is present in less than 0.5% of the general
population, but in up to 10% in patients with congenital heart
disease.[5]
Superior vena cava obstruction refers to a partial or complete
obstruction of the superior vena cava, typically in the context of
cancer such as a cancer of the lung, metastatic cancer, or
lymphoma. Obstruction can lead to enlarged veins in the head
and neck, and may also cause breathlessness, cough, chest pain,
and difficulty swallowing. Pemberton's sign may be positive.
Tumours 
causing 
obstruction 
may 
be 
treated 
with
chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to reduce their effects, and
corticosteroids may also be given.[6]
In tricuspid valve regurgitation, these pulsations are very strong.
No valve divides the superior vena cava from the right atrium.
As a result, the (right) atrial and (right) ventricular contractions
are conducted up into the internal jugular vein and, through the
sternocleidomastoid muscle, can be seen as the jugular venous
pressure.
