Vein
Veins (/veɪn/) are blood vessels in the circulatory system of
humans and most other animals that carry blood towards the heart.
Most veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the
heart; exceptions are those of the pulmonary and fetal circulations
which carry oxygenated blood to the heart. In the systemic
circulation, arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart,
and veins return deoxygenated blood to the heart, in the deep
veins.[1]
There are three sizes of veins: large, medium, and small. Smaller
veins are called venules, and the smallest the post-capillary venules
are microscopic that make up the veins of the microcirculation.[2]
Veins are often closer to the skin than arteries.
Veins have less smooth muscle and connective tissue and wider
internal diameters than arteries. Because of their thinner walls and
wider lumens they are able to expand and hold more blood. This
greater capacity gives them the term of capacitance vessels. At any
time, nearly 70% of the total volume of blood in the human body is
in the veins.[3] In medium and large sized veins the flow of blood
is maintained by one-way (unidirectional) venous valves to prevent
backflow.[3][1] In the lower limbs this is also aided by muscle
pumps, also known as venous pumps that exert pressure on
intramuscular veins when they contract and drive blood back to the
heart.[4]

Anatomical terminology
There are three sizes of vein, large, medium, and small. Smaller
veins are called venules. The smallest veins are the post-capillary
venules. Veins have a similar three-layered structure to arteries. The
layers known as tunicae have a concentric arrangement that forms
the wall of the vessel. The outer layer, is a thick layer of connective
tissue called the tunica externa or adventitia; this layer is absent in
the post-capillary venules.[4] The middle layer, consists of bands of
smooth muscle and is known as the tunica media. The inner layer,
is a thin lining of endothelium known as the tunica intima. The
tunica media in the veins is much thinner than that in the arteries as
the veins are not subject to the high systolic pressures that the
arteries are. There are valves present in many veins that maintain
unidirectional flow.
Unlike arteries, the precise location of veins varies among individuals.[5]
Veins close to the surface of the skin appear blue for a variety of reasons. The factors that contribute to this
alteration of color perception are related to the light-scattering properties of the skin and the processing of
visual input by the visual cortex, rather than the actual colour of the venous blood which is dark red.[6]
Veins of the human body
Main veins of the systemic circulation
Venous system
Veins of the circulatory system
The venous system is the system of veins in the systemic and pulmonary circulations that return blood to the
heart. In the systemic circulation the return is of deoxygenated blood from the organs and tissues of the
body, and in the pulmonary circulation the pulmonary veins return oxygenated blood from the lungs to the
heart. Almost 70% of the blood in the body is in the veins, and almost 75% of this blood is in the small
veins and venules.[7] All of the systemic veins are tributaries of the largest veins, the superior and inferior
vena cava, which empty the oxygen-depleted blood into the right atrium of the heart.[8] The thin walls of
the veins, and their greater internal diameters (lumens) enable them to hold a greater volume of blood, and
this greater capacitance gives them the term of capacitance vessels.[4] This characteristic also allows for the
accommodation of pressure changes in the system. The whole of the venous system, bar the post-capillary
venules is a large volume, low pressure system.[9] The venous system is often asymmetric, and whilst the
main veins hold a relatively constant position, unlike arteries, the precise location of veins varies among
individuals.[5][7]
Veins vary in size from the smallest post-capillary venules, and more muscular venules, to small veins,
medium veins, and large veins. The thickness of the walls of the veins varies as to their location – in the
legs the vein walls are much thicker than those in the arms.[10] In the circulatory system, blood first enters
the venous system from capillary beds where arterial blood changes to venous blood.
Positions of venae cavae and
vessels of the pulmonary circulation
Deep and superficial veins of the arm
and near thorax
Large arteries such as the thoracic aorta, subclavian, femoral and
popliteal arteries lie close to a single vein that drains the same
region. Other arteries are often accompanied by a pair of veins held
in a connective tissue sheath. The accompanying veins are known
as venae comitantes, or satellite veins, and they run on either side of
the artery. When an associated nerve is also enclosed, the sheath is
known as a neurovascular bundle.[11] This close proximity of the
artery to the veins helps in venous return due to the pulsations in the
artery.[12] It also allows for the promotion of heat transfer from the
larger arteries to the veins in a counterflow exchange that helps to
preserve normal body heat.[11]
Venules
The first entry of venous blood is from the convergence of two or
more capillaries into a microscopic, post-capillary venule.[13] Post-
capillary venules have a diameter of between 10 and 30
micrometres (μm), and are part of the microcirculation. Their
endothelium is made up of flattened oval or polygon shaped cells
surrounded by a basal lamina. Post-capillary venules are too small
to have a smooth muscle layer and are instead supported by
pericytes that wrap around them.[14] Post-capillary venules become
muscular venules when they reach a diameter of 50 μm,[10] and can
reach a diameter of 1 mm.[13] These larger venules feed into small
veins.
Small, medium, and large veins
The small veins merge to feed as tributaries into medium-sized
veins. The medium veins feed into the large veins which include the
internal jugular, and renal veins, and the venae cavae that carry the
blood directly into the heart.[13] The venae cavae enter the right atrium of the heart from above and below.
From above, the superior vena cava carries blood from the arms, head, and chest to the right atrium of the
heart, and from below, the inferior vena cava carries blood from the legs and abdomen to the right atrium.
The inferior vena cava is the larger of the two. The inferior vena cava is retroperitoneal and runs to the right
and roughly parallel to the abdominal aorta along the spine.
Deep, superficial, and perforator veins
The three main compartments of the venous system are the deep veins, the superficial veins, and the
perforator veins.[15] Superficial veins are those closer to the surface of the body, and have no corresponding
arteries. Deep veins are deeper in the body and have corresponding arteries. Perforator veins drain from the
superficial to the deep veins.[16] These are usually referred to in the lower limbs and feet.[17] Superficial
veins include the very small spider veins of between 0.5 and 1  mm diameter, and reticular or feeder
veins.[18]
Venous plexuses
Video of valve in popliteal vein
Venous valve stopping backflow
There are a number of venous plexuses where veins are grouped or sometimes combined in networks at
certain body sites. The Batson venous plexus, runs through the inner vertebral column connecting the
thoracic and pelvic veins. These veins are noted for being valveless, believed to be the reason for metastasis
of certain cancers.
A subcutaneous venous plexus is continuous, and a high rate of flow is supplied by small arteriovenous
anastomoses. The high rate of flow ensures heat transfer to the vein wall.[19]
Blood flows back to the heart in the systemic deep veins, with the
flow of blood maintained by one-way valves in the deep veins,
superficial veins, and in the perforator veins.[20] The venous valves
serve to prevent regurgitation (backflow) due to the low pressure of
veins, and the pull of gravity.[1] They also serve to prevent the over-
widening of the vein.[20][21]
A venous valve is bicuspid (having two leaflets) and is formed by
an infolding of part of the tunica intima on either side of the lumen
of the veins. The leaflets are strengthened with collagen, and elastic
fibres, and covered with endothelium.[10] The endothelial cells on
the surfaces of the leaflets facing the vein wall, are arranged
transversely. On the leaflet surfaces that open to let the blood flow,
the cells are arranged longitudinally in the direction of the flow. The
leaflets are attached to the venous wall at their convex edges. Their
margins are concave and are directed with the flow lying against the
wall.[4] As the valve forms, the vein wall where the leaflets attach,
becomes dilated on each side. These widenings form the pockets,
hollow cup-shaped regions, on the cardial side, known as the
valvular sinuses.[22] The endothelial cells in the sinuses are able to
stretch twice as much as those in areas without valves.[22] When the blood tries to reverse its direction (due
to low venous pressure and the pull of gravity), the sinuses fill first closing the leaflets and keeping them
together.[4][8] Approximately 95% of the venous valves are in the small veins of less than 300
micrometres.[23]
The deep veins of the lower limb include the common femoral vein, femoral vein, and the deep femoral
vein; the popliteal vein, the tibial, and fibular veins. In the common femoral vein one valve is located above
the saphenofemoral junction called the suprasaphenic valve. There are sometimes two valves in the same
tract. In the femoral vein there are often three valves, the most constantly found valve is just below the
joining of the deep femoral vein. The deep femoral vein and its perforators have valves. In the popliteal
veins there are between one and three valves; in each posterior tibial vein there are between 8 and 19
valves, and in the anterior tibial veins there are between 8 and 11 valves.[20]
In the superficial veins there are between one and seven valves along the thigh portion of the great
saphenous vein (GSV); two to six below the knee and one to four in the marginal veins of the foot. There is
a valve at the termination of the GSV known as the terminal valve to prevent reflux from the femoral vein A
Venous valves
Diagram showing venous blood flow from capillary
beds in some specific locations including the lungs,
liver, and kidneys
preterminal valve is located just below the openings of the tributaries to prevent reflux form these into the
GSV.[20] Incompetence of the GSV is a common cause of varicose veins.
The valves also divide the column of blood into segments which helps move the blood unidirectionally to
the heart.[24] Their action is supported by the action of skeletal muscle pumps that contract and compress
the veins. A skeletal muscle is confined in its fascia and contraction of the muscle which makes it wider
results In compression on the vein that pushes the blood forward.[8] Valves in the perforating veins close
when a calf muscle contracts, to prevent backflow from the deep veins to the superficial.[25] There are more
valves in the lower leg, due to increased gravitational pull, with the number decreasing as the veins travel to
the hip. There are no valves in the veins of the thorax or abdomen.[4]
There is a valve at the junction of the inferior vena cava (one of the great vessels) and the right atrium
known as the valve of inferior vena cava also known as the eustachian valve. This valve is an
embryological remnant and is insignificant in the adult. However, when persistent it can cause problems.[26]
There are some separate parallel systemic circulatory
routes that supply specific regions, and organs.[8]
They include the coronary circulation, the cerebral
circulation, the bronchial circulation, and the renal
circulation.
Coronary circulation
In the coronary circulation, the blood supply to the
heart, is drained by cardiac veins (or coronary veins)
that remove the deoxygenated blood from the heart
muscle. These include the great cardiac vein, the
middle cardiac vein, the small cardiac vein, the
smallest cardiac veins, and the anterior cardiac veins.
Cardiac veins carry blood with a poor level of
oxygen, from the heart muscle to the right atrium. Most of the blood of the cardiac veins returns through the
coronary sinus. The anatomy of the veins of the heart is very variable, but generally it is formed by the
following veins: heart veins that go into the coronary sinus: the great cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein,
the small cardiac vein, the posterior vein of the left ventricle, and the oblique vein of the left atrium (oblique
vein of Marshall). Heart veins that go directly to the right atrium: the anterior cardiac veins, and the smallest
cardiac veins (Thebesian veins).[27]
Bronchial circulation
In the bronchial circulation that supplies blood to the lung tissues, bronchial veins drain venous blood from
the large main bronchi into the azygous vein, and ultimately the right atrium. Venous blood from the
bronchi inside the lungs drains into the pulmonary veins and empties into the left atrium; since this blood
never went through a capillary bed it was never oxygenated and so provides a small amount of shunted
deoxygenated blood into the systemic circulation.[28]
Cerebral circulation
Circulatory routes
In the cerebral circulation supplying the cerebrum the venous drainage can be separated into two
subdivisions: superficial and deep. The superficial system is composed of dural venous sinuses, which have
walls composed of dura mater as opposed to a traditional vein. The dural sinuses are therefore located on
the surface of the cerebrum. The most prominent of these sinuses is the superior sagittal sinus which flows
in the sagittal plane under the midline of the cerebral vault, posteriorly and inferiorly to the confluence of
sinuses, where the superficial drainage joins with the sinus that primarily drains the deep venous system.
From here, two transverse sinuses bifurcate and travel laterally and inferiorly in an S-shaped curve that
forms the sigmoid sinuses which go on to form the two jugular veins. In the neck, the jugular veins parallel
the upward course of the carotid arteries and drain blood into the superior vena cava.
The deep venous drainage is primarily composed of traditional veins inside the deep structures of the brain,
which join behind the midbrain to form the vein of Galen. This vein merges with the inferior sagittal sinus
to form the straight sinus which then joins the superficial venous system mentioned above at the confluence
of sinuses.
Portal venous systems
A portal venous system is a series of veins or venules that directly connect two capillary beds. The two
systems in verebrates are the hepatic portal system, and the hypophyseal portal system.
Anastomoses
An anastomosis is a joining of two structures such as blood vessels. In the circulation these are called
circulatory anastomoses, one of which is the join between an artery with a vein known as an arteriovenous
anastomosis. This connection which is highly muscular, enables venous blood to travel directly from an
artery into a vein without having passed from a capillary bed.[19][14]
Abnormal connections can be present known as arteriovenous malformations. These are usually congenital
and the connections are made from a tangle of capillaries.[29] A cerebral arteriovenous malformation is one
that is located in the brain. An irregular connection between an artery and a vein is known as arteriovenous
fistula.
A small specialised arteriovenous anastomosis known as a glomus body or organ serves to transfer heat in
the fingers and toes. The small connection is surrounded by a capsule of thickened connective tissue. In the
hands and feet there are a great number of glomera.[14]
Vascular shunt
A vascular shunt can also bypass the capillary bed and provide a route for blood supply directly to a
collecting venule. This is achieved by a metarteriole that supplies around a hundred capillaries. At their
junctions are precapillary sphincters that tightly regulate the flow of blood into the capillary bed. When all
of the sphincters are closed blood can flow from a metarteriole into a thoroughfare channel and into a
collecting venule bypassing the capillary bed.[21][4]

proportions
A communicating vein directly connects two parts of the same system such as the Giacomini vein that
connects the (superficial) small saphenous vein with the (superficial) great saphenous vein. Peripheral veins
carry blood from the limbs and hands and feet.
The three layers of the vein wall are the outer tunica externa, the middle tunica
media and the inner tunica intima. There are also numerous valves present in
many of the veins.
The outer tunica externa, also known as the tunica adventitia is a sheath of thick
connective tissue. This layer is absent in the post-capillary venules.[8]
The middle tunica media is mainly of vascular smooth muscle cells, elastic fibers
and collagen. This layer is much thinner than that in arteries.[30] Vascular smooth
muscle cells control the size of the vein lumens, and thereby help to regulate blood
pressure.[31]
The inner tunica intima is a lining of endothelium comprising a single layer of
extremely flattened epithelial cells, supported by delicate connective tissue.[8] This
subendothelium is a thin but variable connective tissue.[4] The tunica intima has
the most variation in blood vessels, in terms of their wall thickness and relative size of their lumen. The
endothelial cells continuously produce nitric oxide a soluble gas, to the cells of the adjacent smooth muscle
layer. This constant synthesis is carried out by the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).[32]
Other endothelial secretions are endothelin, and thromboxane (vasoconstrictors), and prostacyclin a
vasodilator.[9]
The development of the embryo is completely reliant on the vitelline circulation, the bidirectional flow of
blood between the yolk sac and the embryo. The yolk sac is the first extraembryonic structure to appear.
This circulation is critical in allowing the exchange of nutrients, prior to the full development of the
placenta.[33] By day 17 vessels begin to form in the yolk sac, arising from the splanchnic mesoderm of the
yolk sac wall.[34] The capillaries are formed during vasculogenesis, and they lengthen and interconnect to
form an extensive primitive vascular network.[35] Blood is supplied from the primitive aorta, and drained by
vitelline veins from the yolk sac to the embryo. By the end of the third week the yolk sac, connecting stalk,
and chorionic villi are entirely vascularised.[35]
In the middle of the fourth week the heart begins to beat and the circulation of blood begins. The primitive
outflow tract is of three pairs of aortic arches. The inflow tract is formed of six paired veins, the vitelline
veins, umbilical veins, and the cardinal veins.[36]
In the systemic circulation, veins serve to return oxygen-depleted blood from organs, and tissues to the right
heart. From here it passes to the pulmonary arteries for the pulmonary circulation to return oxygen-rich
blood to the left heart in the pulmonary veins, to be pumped back into the systemic circulation to complete
the cycle. Veins have thinner walls than arteries, and a wider diameter that allow them to expand and hold a

greater volume of blood. This gives them a functional role of capacitance that makes possible the
accommodation of different pressures in the system. The venous system apart from the post-capillary
venules is a high volume, low pressure system. Vascular smooth muscle cells control the size of the vein
lumens, and thereby help to regulate blood pressure.[31]
The post-capillary venules are exchange vessels whose ultra-thin walls allow the ready diffusion of
molecules from the capillaries.[10]
The return of blood to the heart is assisted by the action of the muscle pump, and by the thoracic pump
action of breathing during respiration. Standing or sitting for a prolonged period of time can cause low
venous return from venous pooling (vascular) shock. Fainting can occur but usually baroreceptors within
the aortic sinuses initiate a baroreflex such that angiotensin II and norepinephrine stimulate vasoconstriction
and heart rate increases to return blood flow. Neurogenic and hypovolaemic shock can also cause fainting.
In these cases, the smooth muscles surrounding the veins become slack and the veins fill with the majority
of the blood in the body, keeping blood away from the brain and causing unconsciousness. Jet pilots wear
pressurized suits to help maintain their venous return and blood pressure.
Most venous diseases involve obstruction such as a thrombus or insufficiency of the valves, or both of
these.[37][20] Other conditions may be due to inflammation, or compression. Ageing is a major independent
risk factor for venous disorders.[38] The medical speciality involved with the diagnosis and treatment of
venous disorders is known as phlebology (also venology), and the specialist concerned is a phlebologist.[39]
There are a number of vascular surgeries and endovascular surgeries carried out by vascular surgeons to
treat many venous diseases.
Venous insufficiency is the most common disorder of the venous system, and is usually manifested as either
spider veins or varicose veins. Several treatments are available including endovenous thermal ablation
(using radiofrequency or laser energy), vein stripping, ambulatory phlebectomy, foam sclerotherapy, laser,
or compression.
Postphlebitic syndrome is venous insufficiency that develops following deep vein thrombosis.[40]
Venous thrombosis is the formation of a thrombus (blood clot) in a vein. This most commonly affects a deep
vein known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but can also affect a superficial vein known as superficial vein
thrombosis (SVT).
DVT usually occurs in the veins of the legs, although it can also occur in the deep veins of the arms.[41]
Immobility, active cancer, obesity, traumatic damage and congenital disorders that make clots more likely
are all risk factors for deep vein thrombosis. It can cause the affected limb to swell, and cause pain and an
overlying skin rash. In the worst case, a deep vein thrombosis can extend, or a part of a clot can break off as
an embolus and lodge in a pulmonary artery in the lungs, known as a pulmonary embolism.
Clinical significance
Venous insufficiency
Venous thrombosis
Deep vein thrombosis
The decision to treat deep vein thrombosis depends on its size, symptoms, and their risk factors. It generally
involves anticoagulation to prevents clots or to reduce the size of the clot. Intermittent pneumatic
compression is a method used to improve venous circulation in cases of edema or in those at risk from a
deep vein thrombosis.
SVT is the development of a thrombus in a superficial vein. SVT is not normally clinically significant, but
the thrombus can migrate into the deep venous system where it can also give rise to a pulmonary
embolism.[42] The main risk factor for SVT in the lower limbs is varicose veins.[42]
The portal vein also known as the hepatic portal vein carries blood drained from most of the gastrointestinal
tract to the liver. Portal hypertension is mainly caused by cirrhosis of the liver. Other causes can include an
obstructing clot in a hepatic vein (Budd Chiari syndrome) or compression from tumors or tuberculosis
lesions. When the pressure increases in the portal vein, a collateral circulation develops, causing visible
veins such as esophageal varices.
Phlebitis is the inflammation of a vein. It is usually accompanied by a blood clot when it is known as
thrombophlebitis. When the affected vein is a superficial vein in the leg, it is known as superficial
thrombophlebitis, and unlike deep vein thrombosis there is little risk of the clot breaking off as an
embolus.[43]
Some disorders as syndromes result from compression of a vein. These include a venous type of thoracic
outlet syndrome, due to compression of a subclavian vein; nutcracker syndrome most usually due to
compression of the left renal vein, and May–Thurner syndrome associated with compression of the iliac
vein which can lead to iliofemoral DVT. Compression of the superior vena cava most usually by a
malignant tumor can lead to superior vena cava syndrome.[44]
A vascular anomaly can be either a vascular tumor or a birthmark, or a vascular malformation. [45] In a
tumor such as infantile hemangioma the mass is soft, and easily compressed, and their coloring is due to the
dilated anomalous involved veins.[46] They are most commonly found in the head and neck. Venous
malformations are the type of vascular malformation that involves the veins. They can often extend deeper
from their surface appearance, reaching underlying muscle or bone.[47] In the neck they may extend into the
lining of the mouth cavity or into the salivary glands.[46] They are the most common of the vascular
malformations.[48] A severe venous malformation can involve the lymph vessels as a lymphaticovenous
malformation.[46]

Venous access is any method used to access the bloodstream through the veins, either to administer
intravenous therapy such as medication, or fluid, parenteral nutrition, to obtain blood for analysis, or to
provide an access point for blood-based treatments such as dialysis or apheresis. Access is most commonly
achieved via the placement of a central venous catheter, a Seldinger technique, and guidance tools such as
ultrasound and fluoroscopy can also be used to assist with access location.
Ultrasound, particularly duplex ultrasound, is the most usual and widely used way of viewing veins in the
diagnosis of venous disease.[49][50] Venography is an invasive procedure that uses a catheter to deliver a
contrast agent in giving an X-ray of veins. An augmented reality healthcare application is a near-infrared
vein finder that films subcutaneous veins, and projects their image either onto a screen or onto the person's
skin.[51]
Some imaging techniques using veins have been developed for identification purposes. These vein
matching technologies, include finger vein recognition,[52] and eye vein verification.
The Greek physician Herophilus (born 335 BC) distinguished veins from arteries, noting the thicker walls
of arteries, but thought that the pulse was a property of arteries themselves. Greek anatomist Erasistratus
observed that arteries that were cut during life bleed. He ascribed the fact to the phenomenon that air
escaping from an artery is replaced with blood that entered by very small vessels between veins and arteries.
Thus he apparently postulated capillaries but with reversed flow of blood.[53]
In 2nd century AD Rome, the Greek physician Galen knew that blood vessels carried blood and identified
venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions.
Growth and energy were derived from venous blood created in the liver from chyle, while arterial blood
gave vitality by containing pneuma (air) and originated in the heart. Blood flowed from both creating
organs to all parts of the body where it was consumed and there was no return of blood to the heart or liver.
The heart did not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood
moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves.
Galen believed that the arterial blood was created by venous blood
passing from the left ventricle to the right by passing through 'pores'
in the interventricular septum, air passed from the lungs via the
pulmonary artery to the left side of the heart. As the arterial blood
was created 'sooty' vapors were created and passed to the lungs also
via the pulmonary artery to be exhaled.
In addition, Ibn al-Nafis had an insight into what would become a
larger theory of the capillary circulation. He stated that "there must
be small communications or pores (manafidh in Arabic) between
the pulmonary artery and vein," a prediction that preceded the

History
discovery of the capillary system by more than 400 years.[54] Ibn al-Nafis' theory, however, was confined to
blood transit in the lungs and did not extend to the entire body.
Finally, William Harvey, a pupil of Hieronymus Fabricius (who had earlier described the valves of the veins
without recognizing their function), performed a sequence of experiments, and published Exercitatio
Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus in 1628, which "demonstrated that there had to be a
direct connection between the venous and arterial systems throughout the body, and not just the lungs. Most
importantly, he argued that the beat of the heart produced a continuous circulation of blood through minute
connections at the extremities of the body. This is a conceptual leap that was quite different from Ibn al-
Nafis' refinement of the anatomy and bloodflow in the heart and lungs."[55] This work, with its essentially
correct exposition, slowly convinced the medical world. However, Harvey was not able to identify the
capillary system connecting arteries and veins; these were later discovered by Marcello Malpighi in
1661.[56]
