Anatomical terms of microanatomy
Red blood cell
Red blood cells (RBCs), scientific name erythrocytes (from
ancient Greek erythros 'red' and kytos 'hollow vessel', with -
cyte translated as 'cell' in modern usage), also known as red
cells,[1] erythroid cells, and rarely haematids, are the most
common type of blood cell and the vertebrate's principal means
of delivering oxygen (O2) to the body tissues—via blood flow
through the circulatory system.[2] Erythrocytes take up oxygen
in the lungs, or in fish the gills, and release it into tissues while
squeezing through the body's capillaries.
The cytoplasm of a red blood cell is rich in hemoglobin, an
iron-containing biomolecule that can bind oxygen and is
responsible for the red color of the cells and the blood. Each
human red blood cell contains approximately 270  million
hemoglobin molecules.[3] The cell membrane is composed of
proteins and lipids, and this structure provides properties
essential for physiological cell function such as deformability
and stability of the blood cell while traversing the circulatory
system and specifically the capillary network.
In humans, mature red blood cells are flexible biconcave disks.
They lack a cell nucleus (which is expelled during
development) and organelles, to accommodate maximum space
for hemoglobin; they can be viewed as sacks of hemoglobin,
with a plasma membrane as the sack. Approximately
2.4 million new erythrocytes are produced per second in human
adults.[4] The cells develop in the bone marrow and circulate
for about 100–120 days in the body before their components
are recycled by macrophages. Each circulation takes about 60
seconds (one minute).[5] Approximately 84% of the cells in the
human body are the 20–30  trillion red blood cells.[6][7][8][9]
Nearly half of the blood's volume (40% to 45%) is red blood
cells.
There is an immense size
variation in vertebrate red blood
cells, as well as a correlation
between cell and nucleus size.
Mammalian red blood cells, which
do not contain nuclei, are
considerably smaller than those
of most other vertebrates.[10]
Packed red blood cells are red blood cells that have been donated, processed, and stored in a blood bank for
blood transfusion.
The vast majority of vertebrates, including mammals and humans, have
red blood cells. Red blood cells are cells present in blood to transport
oxygen. The only known vertebrates without red blood cells are the
crocodile icefish (family Channichthyidae); they live in very oxygen-
rich cold water and transport oxygen freely dissolved in their blood.[11]
While they no longer use hemoglobin, remnants of hemoglobin genes
can be found in their genome.[12]
Vertebrate red blood cells consist mainly of hemoglobin, a complex
metalloprotein containing heme groups whose iron atoms temporarily
bind to oxygen molecules (O2) in the lungs or gills and release them
throughout the body. Oxygen can easily diffuse through the red blood
cell's cell membrane. Hemoglobin in the red blood cells also carries
some of the waste product carbon dioxide back from the tissues; most
waste carbon dioxide, however, is transported back to the pulmonary
capillaries of the lungs as bicarbonate (HCO3
−) dissolved in the blood
plasma. Myoglobin, a compound related to hemoglobin, acts to store
oxygen in muscle cells.[13]
The color of red blood cells is due to the heme group of hemoglobin.
The blood plasma alone is straw-colored, but the red blood cells
change color depending on the state of the hemoglobin: when
combined with oxygen the resulting oxyhemoglobin is scarlet, and
when oxygen has been released the resulting deoxyhemoglobin is of a
dark red burgundy color. However, blood can appear bluish when seen
through the vessel wall and skin.[14] Pulse oximetry takes advantage of
the hemoglobin color change to directly measure the arterial blood oxygen saturation using colorimetric
techniques. Hemoglobin also has a very high affinity for carbon monoxide, forming carboxyhemoglobin
which is a very bright red in color. Flushed, confused patients with a saturation reading of 100% on pulse
oximetry are sometimes found to be suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.
Having oxygen-carrying proteins inside specialized cells (as opposed to oxygen carriers being dissolved in
body fluid) was an important step in the evolution of vertebrates as it allows for less viscous blood, higher
concentrations of oxygen, and better diffusion of oxygen from the blood to the tissues. The size of red
blood cells varies widely among vertebrate species; red blood cell width is on average about 25% larger
than capillary diameter, and it has been hypothesized that this improves the oxygen transfer from red blood
cells to tissues.[15]

Vertebrates
Mammals
Mature red blood cells of birds have
a nucleus, however in the blood of
adult females of penguin Pygoscelis
papua enucleated red blood cells (B)
have been observed, but with very
low frequency.
Typical mammalian red blood cells: (a) seen from
surface; (b) in profile, forming rouleaux; (c)
rendered spherical by water; (d) rendered crenate
(shrunken and spiky) by salt. (c) and (d) do not
normally occur in the body. The last two shapes
are due to water being transported into, and out of,
the cells, by osmosis.
The red blood cells of mammals are typically shaped as biconcave
disks: flattened and depressed in the center, with a dumbbell-shaped
cross section, and a torus-shaped rim on the edge of the disk. This
shape allows for a high surface-area-to-volume (SA/V) ratio to
facilitate diffusion of gases.[16] However, there are some exceptions
concerning shape in the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates
including cattle, deer, and their relatives), which displays a wide
variety of bizarre red blood cell morphologies: small and highly
ovaloid cells in llamas and camels (family Camelidae), tiny
spherical cells in mouse deer (family Tragulidae), and cells which
assume fusiform, lanceolate, crescentic, and irregularly polygonal
and other angular forms in red deer and wapiti (family Cervidae).
Members of this order have clearly evolved a mode of red blood
cell development substantially different from the mammalian
norm.[10][17] Overall, mammalian red blood cells are remarkably
flexible and deformable so as to squeeze through tiny capillaries, as
well as to maximize their apposing surface by assuming a cigar
shape, where they efficiently release their oxygen
load.[18]
Red blood cells in mammals are unique amongst
vertebrates as they do not have nuclei when mature.
They do have nuclei during early phases of
erythropoiesis, but extrude them during development
as they mature; this provides more space for
hemoglobin. The red blood cells without nuclei, called
reticulocytes, subsequently lose all other cellular
organelles such as their mitochondria, Golgi apparatus
and endoplasmic reticulum.
The spleen acts as a reservoir of red blood cells, but
this effect is somewhat limited in humans. In some
other mammals such as dogs and horses, the spleen
sequesters large numbers of red blood cells, which are
dumped into the blood during times of exertion stress,
yielding a higher oxygen transport capacity.
A typical human red blood cell has a disk diameter of approximately 6.2–8.2 μm[19] and a thickness at the
thickest point of 2–2.5 μm and a minimum thickness in the centre of 0.8–1 μm, being much smaller than
most other human cells. These cells have an average volume of about 90 fL[20] with a surface area of about
136 μm2, and can swell up to a sphere shape containing 150 fL, without membrane distension.
Adult humans have roughly 20–30 trillion red blood cells at any given time, constituting approximately
70% of all cells by number.[21] Women have about 4–5  million red blood cells per microliter (cubic
millimeter) of blood and men about 5–6 million; people living at high altitudes with low oxygen tension will

have more. Red blood cells are thus much more common than the
other blood particles: there are about 4,000–11,000 white blood cells
and about 150,000–400,000 platelets per microliter.
Human red blood cells take on average 60 seconds to complete one
cycle of circulation.[5][9][22]
The blood's red color is due to the spectral properties of the hemic iron
ions in hemoglobin. Each hemoglobin molecule carries four heme
groups; hemoglobin constitutes about a third of the total cell volume.
Hemoglobin is responsible for the transport of more than 98% of the
oxygen in the body (the remaining oxygen is carried dissolved in the
blood plasma). The red blood cells of an average adult human male
store collectively about 2.5 grams of iron, representing about 65% of
the total iron contained in the body.[23][24]
Red blood cells in mammals are anucleate when mature, meaning that
they lack a cell nucleus. In comparison, the red blood cells of other
vertebrates have nuclei; the only known exceptions are salamanders of
the family Plethodontidae, where five different clades has evolved
various degrees of enucleated red blood cells (most evolved in some
species of the genus Batrachoseps), and fish of the genus
Maurolicus.[25][26][27]
The elimination of the nucleus in vertebrate red blood cells has been
offered as an explanation for the subsequent accumulation of non-
coding DNA in the genome.[17] The argument runs as follows:
Efficient gas transport requires red blood cells to pass through very
narrow capillaries, and this constrains their size. In the absence of
nuclear elimination, the accumulation of repeat sequences is
constrained by the volume occupied by the nucleus, which increases
with genome size.
Nucleated red blood cells in mammals consist of two forms:
normoblasts, which are normal erythropoietic precursors to mature red
blood cells, and megaloblasts, which are abnormally large precursors
that occur in megaloblastic anemias.
Red blood cells are deformable, flexible, are able to adhere to other cells, and are able to interface with
immune cells. Their membrane plays many roles in this. These functions are highly dependent on the
membrane composition. The red blood cell membrane is composed of 3 layers: the glycocalyx on the

exterior, which is rich in carbohydrates; the lipid bilayer which contains many transmembrane proteins,
besides its lipidic main constituents; and the membrane skeleton, a structural network of proteins located on
the inner surface of the lipid bilayer. Half of the membrane mass in human and most mammalian red blood
cells are proteins. The other half are lipids, namely phospholipids and cholesterol.[28]
The red blood cell membrane comprises a typical lipid bilayer,
similar to what can be found in virtually all human cells.
Simply put, this lipid bilayer is composed of cholesterol and
phospholipids in equal proportions by weight. The lipid
composition is important as it defines many physical properties
such as membrane permeability and fluidity. Additionally, the
activity of many membrane proteins is regulated by interactions
with lipids in the bilayer.
Unlike cholesterol, which is evenly distributed between the
inner and outer leaflets, the 5 major phospholipids are
asymmetrically disposed, as shown below:
Outer monolayer
Phosphatidylcholine (PC);
Sphingomyelin (SM).
Inner monolayer
Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE);
Phosphoinositol (PI) (small amounts).
Phosphatidylserine (PS);
This asymmetric phospholipid distribution among the bilayer is
the result of the function of several energy-dependent and energy-independent phospholipid transport
proteins. Proteins called "Flippases" move phospholipids from the outer to the inner monolayer, while
others called "floppases" do the opposite operation, against a concentration gradient in an energy-dependent
manner. Additionally, there are also "scramblase" proteins that move phospholipids in both directions at the
same time, down their concentration gradients in an energy-independent manner. There is still considerable
debate ongoing regarding the identity of these membrane maintenance proteins in the red cell membrane.
The maintenance of an asymmetric phospholipid distribution in the bilayer (such as an exclusive
localization of PS and PIs in the inner monolayer) is critical for the cell integrity and function due to several
reasons:
Macrophages recognize and phagocytose red cells that expose PS at their outer surface.
Thus the confinement of PS in the inner monolayer is essential if the cell is to survive its
frequent encounters with macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system, especially in the
spleen.
Premature destruction of thallassemic and sickle red cells has been linked to disruptions of
lipid asymmetry leading to exposure of PS on the outer monolayer.
An exposure of PS can potentiate adhesion of red cells to vascular endothelial cells,
effectively preventing normal transit through the microvasculature. Thus it is important that
Membrane lipids

PS is maintained only in the inner leaflet of the bilayer to ensure normal blood flow in
microcirculation.
Both PS and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) can regulate membrane
mechanical function, due to their interactions with skeletal proteins such as spectrin and
protein 4.1R. Recent studies have shown that binding of spectrin to PS promotes membrane
mechanical stability. PIP2 enhances the binding of protein band 4.1R to glycophorin C but
decreases its interaction with protein band 3, and thereby may modulate the linkage of the
bilayer to the membrane skeleton.
The presence of specialized structures named "lipid rafts" in the red blood cell membrane have been
described by recent studies. These are structures enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids associated with
specific membrane proteins, namely flotillins, STOMatins (band 7), G-proteins, and β-adrenergic receptors.
Lipid rafts that have been implicated in cell signaling events in nonerythroid cells have been shown in
erythroid cells to mediate β2-adregenic receptor signaling and increase cAMP levels, and thus regulating
entry of malarial parasites into normal red cells.[29][30]
The proteins of the membrane skeleton are responsible for the
deformability, flexibility and durability of the red blood cell,
enabling it to squeeze through capillaries less than half the diameter
of the red blood cell (7–8 μm) and recovering the discoid shape as
soon as these cells stop receiving compressive forces, in a similar
fashion to an object made of rubber.
There are currently more than 50 known membrane proteins, which
can exist in a few hundred up to a million copies per red blood cell.
Approximately 25 of these membrane proteins carry the various
blood group antigens, such as the A, B and Rh antigens, among
many others. These membrane proteins can perform a wide
diversity of functions, such as transporting ions and molecules
across the red cell membrane, adhesion and interaction with other
cells such as endothelial cells, as signaling receptors, as well as
other currently unknown functions. The blood types of humans are
due to variations in surface glycoproteins of red blood cells.
Disorders of the proteins in these membranes are associated with many disorders, such as hereditary

Surface electrostatic potential
The zeta potential is an electrochemical property of cell surfaces that is determined by the net electrical
charge of molecules exposed at the surface of cell membranes of the cell. The normal zeta potential of the
red blood cell is −15.7 millivolts (mV).[35] Much of this potential appears to be contributed by the exposed
sialic acid residues in the membrane: their removal results in zeta potential of −6.06 mV.
Recall that respiration, as illustrated schematically here with a unit of carbohydrate, produces about as many
molecules of carbon dioxide, CO2, as it consumes of oxygen, O2.[36]
Thus, the function of the circulatory system is as much about the transport of carbon dioxide as about the
transport of oxygen. As stated elsewhere in this article, most of the carbon dioxide in the blood is in the
form of bicarbonate ion. The bicarbonate provides a critical pH buffer.[37] Thus, unlike hemoglobin for O2
transport, there is a physiological advantage to not having a specific CO2 transporter molecule.
Red blood cells, nevertheless, play a key role in the CO2 transport process, for two reasons. First, because,
besides hemoglobin, they contain a large number of copies of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase on the inside
of their cell membrane.[38] Carbonic anhydrase, as its name suggests, acts as a catalyst of the exchange
between carbonic acid and carbon dioxide (which is the anhydride of carbonic acid). Because it is a
catalyst, it can affect many CO2 molecules, so it performs its essential role without needing as many copies
as are needed for O2 transport by hemoglobin. In the presence of this catalyst carbon dioxide and carbonic
acid reach an equilibrium very rapidly, while the red cells are still moving through the capillary. Thus it is
the RBC that ensures that most of the CO2 is transported as bicarbonate.[39][40] At physiological pH the
equilibrium strongly favors carbonic acid, which is mostly dissociated into bicarbonate ion.[41]
The H+ ions released by this rapid reaction within RBC, while still in the capillary, act to reduce the oxygen
binding affinity of hemoglobin, the Bohr effect.
The second major contribution of RBC to carbon dioxide transport is that carbon dioxide directly reacts
with globin protein components of hemoglobin to form carbaminohemoglobin compounds. As oxygen is
released in the tissues, more CO2 binds to hemoglobin, and as oxygen binds in the lung, it displaces the
hemoglobin bound CO2, this is called the Haldane effect. Despite the fact that only a small amount of the
CO2 in blood is bound to hemoglobin in venous blood, a greater proportion of the change in CO2 content
between venous and arterial blood comes from the change in this bound CO2.[42] That is, there is always an
abundance of bicarbonate in blood, both venous and arterial, because of its aforementioned role as a pH
buffer.
In summary, carbon dioxide produced by cellular respiration diffuses very rapidly to areas of lower
concentration, specifically into nearby capillaries.[43][44] When it diffuses into a RBC, CO2 is rapidly
converted by the carbonic anhydrase found on the inside of the RBC membrane into bicarbonate ion. The
bicarbonate ions in turn leave the RBC in exchange for chloride ions from the plasma, facilitated by the
Function

band 3 anion transport protein colocated in the RBC membrane. The bicarbonate ion does not diffuse back
out of the capillary, but is carried to the lung. In the lung the lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the
alveoli causes carbon dioxide to diffuse rapidly from the capillary into the alveoli. The carbonic anhydrase
in the red cells keeps the bicarbonate ion in equilibrium with carbon dioxide. So as carbon dioxide leaves
the capillary, and CO2 is displaced by O2 on hemoglobin, sufficient bicarbonate ion converts rapidly to
carbon dioxide to maintain the equilibrium.[38][45][46][47]
When red blood cells undergo shear stress in constricted vessels, they release ATP, which causes the vessel
walls to relax and dilate so as to promote normal blood flow.[48]
When their hemoglobin molecules are deoxygenated, red blood cells release S-Nitrosothiols, which also act
to dilate blood vessels,[49] thus directing more blood to areas of the body depleted of oxygen.
Red blood cells can also synthesize nitric oxide enzymatically, using L-arginine as substrate, as do
endothelial cells.[50] Exposure of red blood cells to physiological levels of shear stress activates nitric oxide
synthase and export of nitric oxide,[51] which may contribute to the regulation of vascular tonus.
Red blood cells can also produce hydrogen sulfide, a signalling gas that acts to relax vessel walls. It is
believed that the cardioprotective effects of garlic are due to red blood cells converting its sulfur compounds
into hydrogen sulfide.[52]
Red blood cells also play a part in the body's immune response: when lysed by pathogens such as bacteria,
their hemoglobin releases free radicals, which break down the pathogen's cell wall and membrane, killing
it.[53][54]
As a result of not containing mitochondria, red blood cells use none of the oxygen they transport; instead
they produce the energy carrier ATP by the glycolysis of glucose and lactic acid fermentation on the
resulting pyruvate.[55][56] Furthermore, the pentose phosphate pathway plays an important role in red blood
cells; see glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency for more information.
As red blood cells contain no nucleus, protein biosynthesis is currently assumed to be absent in these cells.
Because of the lack of nuclei and organelles, mature red blood cells do not contain DNA and cannot
synthesize any RNA (although it does contain RNAs),[57][58] and consequently cannot divide and have
limited repair capabilities.[59] The inability to carry out protein synthesis means that no virus can evolve to
target mammalian red blood cells.[60] However, infection with parvoviruses (such as human parvovirus
B19) can affect erythroid precursors while they still have DNA, as recognized by the presence of giant
pronormoblasts with viral particles and inclusion bodies, thus temporarily depleting the blood of
reticulocytes and causing anemia.[61]
Secondary functions
Cellular processes
Life cycle
Human red blood cells are produced through a process named erythropoiesis, developing from committed
stem cells to mature red blood cells in about 7 days. When matured, in a healthy individual these cells live
in blood circulation for about 100 to 120 days (and 80 to 90 days in a full term infant).[62] At the end of
their lifespan, they are removed from circulation. In many chronic diseases, the lifespan of the red blood
cells is reduced.
Erythropoiesis is the process by which new red blood cells are produced; it lasts about 7 days. Through this
process red blood cells are continuously produced in the red bone marrow of large bones. (In the embryo,
the liver is the main site of red blood cell production.) The production can be stimulated by the hormone
erythropoietin (EPO), synthesised by the kidney. Just before and after leaving the bone marrow, the
developing cells are known as reticulocytes; these constitute about 1% of circulating red blood cells.
The functional lifetime of a red blood cell is about 100–120 days, during which time the red blood cells are
continually moved by the blood flow push (in arteries), pull (in veins) and a combination of the two as they
squeeze through microvessels such as capillaries. They are also recycled in the bone marrow.[63]
The aging red blood cell undergoes changes in its plasma membrane, making it susceptible to selective
recognition by macrophages and subsequent phagocytosis in the mononuclear phagocyte system (spleen,
liver and lymph nodes), thus removing old and defective cells and continually purging the blood. This
process is termed eryptosis, red blood cell programmed death.[64] This process normally occurs at the same
rate of production by erythropoiesis, balancing the total circulating red blood cell count. Eryptosis is
increased in a wide variety of diseases including sepsis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, malaria, sickle cell
anemia, beta-thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, phosphate depletion, iron
deficiency and Wilson's disease. Eryptosis can be elicited by osmotic shock, oxidative stress, and energy
depletion, as well as by a wide variety of endogenous mediators and xenobiotics. Excessive eryptosis is
observed in red blood cells lacking the cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I or the AMP-activated protein
kinase AMPK. Inhibitors of eryptosis include erythropoietin, nitric oxide, catecholamines and high
concentrations of urea.
Much of the resulting breakdown products are recirculated in the body. The heme constituent of
hemoglobin are broken down into iron (Fe3+) and biliverdin. The biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin, which is
released into the plasma and recirculated to the liver bound to albumin. The iron is released into the plasma
to be recirculated by a carrier protein called transferrin. Almost all red blood cells are removed in this
manner from the circulation before they are old enough to hemolyze. Hemolyzed hemoglobin is bound to a
protein in plasma called haptoglobin, which is not excreted by the kidney.[65]

Effect of osmotic pressure on blood

Anemias (or anaemias) are diseases characterized by low oxygen
transport capacity of the blood, because of low red cell count or
some abnormality of the red blood cells or the hemoglobin.
Iron deficiency anemia is the most common anemia; it occurs
when the dietary intake or absorption of iron is insufficient,
and hemoglobin, which contains iron, cannot be formed.
Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease wherein the
body lacks intrinsic factor, required to absorb vitamin B12 from
food. Vitamin B12 is needed for the production of red blood
cells and hemoglobin.
Sickle-cell disease is a genetic disease that results in
abnormal hemoglobin molecules. When these release their
oxygen load in the tissues, they become insoluble, leading to
mis-shaped red blood cells. These sickle shaped red cells are
less deformable and viscoelastic, meaning that they have become rigid and can cause
blood vessel blockage, pain, strokes, and other tissue damage.
Thalassemia is a genetic disease that results in the production of an abnormal ratio of
hemoglobin subunits.
Hereditary spherocytosis syndromes are a group of inherited disorders characterized
by defects in the red blood cell's cell membrane, causing the cells to be small, sphere-
shaped, and fragile instead of donut-shaped and flexible. These abnormal red blood
cells are destroyed by the spleen. Several other hereditary disorders of the red blood
cell membrane are known.[66]
Aplastic anemia is caused by the inability of the bone marrow to produce blood cells.
Pure red cell aplasia is caused by the inability of the bone marrow to produce only red
blood cells.
Hemolysis is the general term for excessive breakdown
of red blood cells. It can have several causes and can
result in hemolytic anemia.
The malaria parasite spends part of its life-cycle in
red blood cells, feeds on their hemoglobin and then
breaks them apart, causing fever. Both sickle-cell
disease and thalassemia are more common in
malaria areas, because these mutations convey
some protection against the parasite.
Polycythemias (or erythrocytoses) are diseases characterized by a surplus of red blood cells.
The increased viscosity of the blood can cause a number of symptoms.
In polycythemia vera the increased number of red blood cells results from an
abnormality in the bone marrow.

thrombotic microangiopathies, present with pathognomonic (diagnostic) red blood cell

try to move past a thrombus.
Red blood cells may be given as part of a blood transfusion. Blood
may be donated from another person, or stored by the recipient at
an earlier date. Donated blood usually requires screening to ensure
that donors do not contain risk factors for the presence of blood-borne diseases, or will not suffer
themselves by giving blood. Blood is usually collected and tested for common or serious blood-borne
diseases including Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV. The blood type (A, B, AB, or O) or the blood product
is identified and matched with the recipient's blood to minimise the likelihood of acute hemolytic transfusion
reaction, a type of transfusion reaction. This relates to the presence of antigens on the cell's surface. After
this process, the blood is stored, and within a short duration is used. Blood can be given as a whole product
or the red blood cells separated as packed red blood cells.
Blood is often transfused when there is known anaemia, active bleeding, or when there is an expectation of
serious blood loss, such as prior to an operation. Before blood is given, a small sample of the recipient's
blood is tested with the transfusion in a process known as cross-matching.
In 2008 it was reported that human embryonic stem cells had been successfully coaxed into becoming red
blood cells in the lab. The difficult step was to induce the cells to eject their nucleus; this was achieved by
growing the cells on stromal cells from the bone marrow. It is hoped that these artificial red blood cells can
eventually be used for blood transfusions.[67]
A human trial is conducted in 2022, using blood cultured from stem cells obtained from donor blood.[68]
Several blood tests involve red blood cells. These include a RBC
count (the number of red blood cells per volume of blood),
calculation of the hematocrit (percentage of blood volume occupied
by red blood cells), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The
blood type needs to be determined to prepare for a blood
transfusion or an organ transplantation.
Many diseases involving red blood cells are diagnosed with a blood
film (or peripheral blood smear), where a thin layer of blood is
smeared on a microscope slide. This may reveal poikilocytosis,
which are variations in red blood cell shape. When red blood cells
sometimes occur as a stack, flat side next to flat side. This is known
as rouleaux formation, and it occurs more often if the levels of
certain serum proteins are elevated, as for instance during
inflammation.

Separation and blood doping
Red blood cells can be obtained from whole blood by centrifugation, which separates the cells from the
blood plasma in a process known as blood fractionation. Packed red blood cells, which are made in this
way from whole blood with the plasma removed, are used in transfusion medicine.[69] During plasma
donation, the red blood cells are pumped back into the body right away and only the plasma is collected.
Some athletes have tried to improve their performance by blood doping: first about 1 litre of their blood is
extracted, then the red blood cells are isolated, frozen and stored, to be reinjected shortly before the
competition. (Red blood cells can be conserved for 5 weeks at −79 °C or −110 °F, or over 10 years using
cryoprotectants[70]) This practice is hard to detect but may endanger the human cardiovascular system
which is not equipped to deal with blood of the resulting higher viscosity. Another method of blood doping
involves injection with erythropoietin to stimulate production of red blood cells. Both practices are banned
by the World Anti-Doping Agency.
The first person to describe red blood cells was the young Dutch biologist Jan Swammerdam, who had
used an early microscope in 1658 to study the blood of a frog.[71] Unaware of this work, Anton van
Leeuwenhoek provided another microscopic description in 1674, this time providing a more precise
description of red blood cells, even approximating their size, "25,000 times smaller than a fine grain of
sand".
In the 1740s, Vincenzo Menghini in Bologna was able to demonstrate the presence of iron by passing
magnets over the powder or ash remaining from heated red blood cells.
In 1901, Karl Landsteiner published his discovery of the three main blood groups—A, B, and C (which he
later renamed to O). Landsteiner described the regular patterns in which reactions occurred when serum
was mixed with red blood cells, thus identifying compatible and conflicting combinations between these
blood groups. A year later Alfred von Decastello and Adriano Sturli, two colleagues of Landsteiner,
identified a fourth blood group—AB.
In 1959, by use of X-ray crystallography, Max Perutz was able to unravel the structure of hemoglobin, the
red blood cell protein that carries oxygen.[72]
The oldest intact red blood cells ever discovered were found in Ötzi the Iceman, a natural mummy of a man
who died around 3255 BCE. These cells were discovered in May 2012.[73]
