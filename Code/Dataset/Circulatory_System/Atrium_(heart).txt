Anatomical terminology
Atrium (heart)
The atrium (Latin: ātrium, lit. 'entry hall'; pl.: atria) is one of
the two upper chambers in the heart that receives blood from
the circulatory system. The blood in the atria is pumped into the
heart ventricles through the atrioventricular mitral and tricuspid
heart valves.
There are two atria in the human heart – the left atrium receives
blood from the pulmonary circulation, and the right atrium
receives blood from the venae cavae of the systemic circulation.
During the cardiac cycle, the atria receive blood while relaxed
in diastole, then contract in systole to move blood to the
ventricles. Each atrium is roughly cube-shaped except for an
ear-shaped projection called an atrial appendage, previously
known as an auricle. All animals with a closed circulatory
system have at least one atrium.
The atrium was formerly called the 'auricle'.[1] That term is still
used to describe this chamber in some other animals, such as
the Mollusca. Auricles in this modern terminology are
distinguished by having thicker muscular walls.
Humans have a four-chambered heart consisting of the right
and left atrium, and the right and left ventricle. The atria are the
two upper chambers which pump blood to the two lower
ventricles.
The right atrium and ventricle are often referred to together as
the right heart, and the left atrium and ventricle as the left heart.
As the atria do not have valves at their inlets,[2] a venous
pulsation is normal, and can be detected in the jugular vein as
the jugular venous pressure.[3][4] Internally, there are the rough
pectinate muscles, and the crista terminalis of His, which act as
a boundary inside the atrium and the smooth-walled part of the
right atrium, the sinus venarum, which are derived from the
sinus venosus. The sinus venarum is the adult remnant of the

sinus venosus and it surrounds the openings of the venae cavae and
the coronary sinus. [5] Attached to each atrium is an atrial
appendage.
The right atrium receives and holds deoxygenated blood from the
superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, anterior cardiac veins,
smallest cardiac veins and the coronary sinus, which it then sends
down to the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve, which in
turn sends it to the pulmonary artery for pulmonary circulation.
The right atrial appendage (lat: auricula atrii dextra) is located at
the front upper surface of the right atrium. Looking from the front, the right atrial appendage appears
wedge-shaped or triangular. Its base surrounds the superior vena cava.[6] The right atrial appendage is a
pouch-like extension of the right atrium and is covered by a trabecula network of pectinate muscles. The
interatrial septum separates the right atrium from the left atrium; this is marked by a depression in the right
atrium – the fossa ovalis. The atria are depolarised by calcium.[6]
The left atrium receives the oxygenated blood from the left and right pulmonary veins, which it pumps to
the left ventricle (through the mitral valve (left atrioventricular valve) for pumping out through the aorta for
systemic circulation.[7][8]
High in the upper part of the left atrium is a muscular ear-shaped pouch –
the left atrial appendage (lat: auricula atrii sinistra). This appears to
"function as a decompression chamber during left ventricular systole and
during other periods when left atrial pressure is high".[9] It also modulates
intravascular volume by secreting natriuretic peptides, namely atrial
natriuretic peptide (ANP), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) into the
coronary sinus, where they enter into the blood circulation.[10]
The left atrial appendage can be seen on a standard posteroanterior X-ray,
where the lower level of the left hilum becomes concave.[11] It can also be
seen clearly using transesophageal echocardiography.[12] The left atrial
appendage can serve as an approach for mitral valve surgery.[13] The
body of the left atrial appendage is anterior to the left atrium and parallel
to the left pulmonary veins. The left pulmonary artery passes
posterosuperiorly and is separated from the atrial appendage by the
transverse sinus.[14] With certain conditions such as atrial fibrillation,[10]

the left atrial appendage may be associated with risks of stroke from blood clot formation, because of which
surgeons may choose to close it during open-heart surgery, using a left atrial appendage occlusion
procedure.[15]
The sinoatrial node (SA node) is located in the posterior aspect of the right atrium, next to the superior vena
cava. This is a group of pacemaker cells which spontaneously depolarize to create an action potential. The
cardiac action potential then spreads across both atria causing them to contract, forcing the blood they hold
into their corresponding ventricles.
The atrioventricular node (AV node) is another node in the cardiac conduction system. This is located
between the atria and the ventricles.
The left atrium is supplied mainly by the left circumflex coronary artery, and its small branches.[16]
The oblique vein of the left atrium is partly responsible for venous drainage; it derives from the embryonic
left superior vena cava.
During embryogenesis at about two weeks, a primitive atrium begins to be formed as one chamber, which
over the following two weeks becomes divided by the septum primum into the left atrium and the right
atrium. The interatrial septum has an opening in the right atrium, the foramen ovale, which provides access
to the left atrium; this connects the two chambers, which is essential for fetal blood circulation. At birth,
when the first breath is taken fetal blood flow is reversed to travel through the lungs. The foramen ovale is
no longer needed and it closes to leave a depression (the fossa ovalis) in the atrial wall.
In some cases, the foramen ovale fails to close. This abnormality is present in approximately 25% of the
general population.[17] This is known as a patent foramen ovale, an atrial septal defect. It is mostly
unproblematic, although it can be associated with paradoxical embolization and stroke.[17]
Within the fetal right atrium, blood from the inferior vena cava and the superior vena cava flow in separate
streams to different locations in the heart; this has been reported to occur through the Coandă effect.[18]
In human physiology, the atria facilitate circulation primarily by allowing uninterrupted venous flow to the
heart during ventricular systole.[19][20] By being partially empty and distensible, atria prevent the
interruption of venous flow to the heart that would occur during ventricular systole if the veins ended at the
inlet valves of the heart. In normal physiologic states, the output of the heart is pulsatile, and the venous
inflow to the heart is continuous and non-pulsatile. But without functioning atria, venous flow becomes
pulsatile, and the overall circulation rate decreases significantly.[21][22]

Atria have four essential characteristics that cause them to promote continuous venous flow. (1) There are
no atrial inlet valves to interrupt blood flow during atrial systole. (2) The atrial systole contractions are
incomplete and thus do not contract to the extent that would block flow from the veins through the atria into
the ventricles. During atrial systole, blood not only empties from the atria to the ventricles, but blood
continues to flow uninterrupted from the veins right through the atria into the ventricles. (3) The atrial
contractions must be gentle enough so that the force of contraction does not exert significant back pressure
that would impede venous flow. (4) The "let go" of the atria must be timed so that they relax before the start
of ventricular contraction, to be able to accept venous flow without interruption.[20][23]
By preventing the inertia of interrupted venous flow that would otherwise occur at each ventricular systole,
atria allow approximately 75% more cardiac output than would otherwise occur. The fact that atrial
contraction is 15% of the amount of the succeeding ventricular ejection has led to a misplaced emphasis on
their role in pumping up the ventricles (the so-called "atrial kick"), whereas the key benefit of atria is in
preventing circulatory inertia and allowing uninterrupted venous flow to the heart.[20][24]
Also of importance in maintaining the blood flow are the presence of atrial volume receptors. These are
low-pressure baroreceptors in the atria, which send signals to the hypothalamus when a drop in atrial
pressure (which indicates a drop in blood volume) is detected. This triggers a release of vasopressin.[25]
In an adult, an atrial septal defect results in the flow of blood in the reverse direction – from the left atrium
to the right – which reduces cardiac output, potentially causing cardiac failure, and in severe or untreated
cases cardiac arrest and sudden death.
In patients with atrial fibrillation, mitral valve disease, and other
conditions, blood clots have a tendency to form in the left atrial
appendage.[9] The clots may dislodge (forming emboli), which may
lead to ischemic damage to the brain, kidneys, or other organs
supplied by the systemic circulation.[26]
In those with uncontrollable atrial fibrillation, left atrial appendage
occlusion may be performed at the time of any open-heart surgery
to prevent future clot formation within the appendage.[27]

Many other animals, including mammals, also have four-chambered hearts, which have a similar function.
Some animals (amphibians and reptiles) have a three-chambered heart, in which the blood from each atrium
is mixed in the single ventricle before being pumped to the aorta. In these animals, the left atrium still serves
the purpose of collecting blood from the pulmonary veins.
In most fish, the circulatory system is very simple: a two-chambered heart including one atrium and one
ventricle. Among sharks, the heart consists of four parts arranged serially: blood flows into the most
posterior part, the sinus venosus, and then to the atrium which moves it to the third part, the ventricle, before
it reaches the conus anteriosus, which itself is connected to the ventral aorta. This is considered a primitive
arrangement, and many vertebrates have condensed the atrium with the sinus venosus and the ventricle with
the conus anteriosus.[28]
With the advent of lungs came a partitioning of the atrium into two parts divided by a septum. Among frogs,
the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood is mixed in the ventricle before being pumped out to the body's
organs; in turtles, the ventricle is almost entirely divided by a septum, but retains an opening through which
some mixing of blood occurs. In birds, mammals, and some other reptiles (alligators in particular) the
partitioning of both chambers is complete. [28]
