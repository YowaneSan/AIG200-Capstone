Chemical structure of nitrofurantoin
Urinary anti-infective agent
Urinary anti-infective agent, also known as urinary antiseptic, is
medication that can eliminate microorganisms causing urinary tract
infection (UTI). UTI can be categorized into two primary types:
cystitis, which refers to lower urinary tract or bladder infection, and
pyelonephritis, which indicates upper urinary tract or kidney
infection.[1] Escherichia coli (E. Coli) is the predominant microbial
trigger of UTIs, accounting for 75% to 95% of reported cases.
Other pathogens such as Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
and Staphylococcus saprophyticus can also cause UTIs.[2][3]
The use of antimicrobial therapy to treat UTIs started in the 20th
century. 
Nitrofurantoin, 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
(TMP/SMX), fosfomycin, and pivmecillinam are currently the first-
line agents for empiric therapy of simple cystitis.[4] On the other hand, the choice of empiric antimicrobial
therapy for pyelonephritis depends on the severity of illness, specific host factors, and the presence of
resistant bacteria. Ceftriaxone is often considered for parenteral treatment, while oral or parenteral
fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, are suitable alternatives for treating
pyelonephritis.[5]
Antimicrobial therapy should be tailored to the individual, considering factors like the severity of illness,
specific host factors, and pathogen resistance in the local community.[1]
Urinary antiseptics are medications that target bacteria in the urinary tract.[6] They can be divided into two
groups: bactericidal agents, and bacteriostatic agents. These antiseptics help prevent infections by
effectively eliminating UTI symptoms through their action on microorganisms.[7][8]
Nitrofurantoin is regarded as the first-line agent for simple cystitis,
with an efficacy rate ranging from 88% to 92%.[9] It can also be a
prophylactic agent to prevent long-term UTIs.[10] This antibacterial
medication is effective against both gram-positive and gram-
negative bacteria.[11] Nitrofurantoin exhibits its bactericidal activity
through various mechanisms, including inhibiting ribosomal
translation, causing bacterial DNA damage and interfering with the
citric acid cycle. However, the specific role of each mechanism
remains to be further explored.[9][11]
Types of urinary anti-infective agent
Urinary bactericidal agents
Nitrofurantoin
Chemical structure of fosfomycin
Chemical structure of beta-lactam
When nitrofurantoin is metabolized, it converts into a reactive intermediate that attacks bacterial ribosomes,
inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.[9][11] This medication is typically taken orally and has minimal
systemic absorption, reducing potential side effects.[12] Common adverse reactions associated with
nitrofurantoin include brown urine discoloration, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, rash, and peripheral
neuropathy.[13]
Fosfomycin is a phosphonic acid bactericidal agent. It is commonly
used as the first-line treatment for acute simple cystitis,
demonstrating a 91% cure rate.[4][9] It is administered orally as a
single dose; In more complicated UTIs, the dose is adjusted to be
repeated every three days to achieve successful eradication.[9]
The bactericidal effect of fosfomycin is attributed to its capability to
inhibit bacterial wall synthesis by inactivating an enzyme called
pyruvyl transferase, which is responsible for microbial cell wall
synthesis.[9] Fosfomycin acts against gram-positive and gram-
negative bacteria. Administration of fosfomycin may lead to side
effects such as headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps.[13]
Beta-lactam antibiotics are often considered as a second-line option
for treating UTIs due to their lower effectiveness compared to other
antibiotics and their potential adverse effects.[14][15] Commonly
used beta-lactam antibiotics for UTIs include cephalosporins and
penicillin. By binding to penicillin-binding proteins through their
beta-lactam rings, beta-lactam antibiotics disrupt the normal
function of these proteins, inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis,
ultimately resulting in cell death.[16]
Cephalosporins are a subclass of beta-lactam family with broad-
spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative
bacteria.[12] They are categorized into five generations.[16] First and
third-generation cephalosporins, like cefalexin and ceftriaxone, are
more commonly used in clinical practice.[17]   Common adverse
effects associated with cephalosporins include hypersensitivity,
rash, anaphylaxis, and seizures.[12]
Penicillin is another widely used subclass that effectively targets various bacteria.[18] However, it is not
regarded as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated cystitis because of the high prevalence of penicillin-
resistant E. coli strains.[12] Within the penicillin class, pivmecillinam is considered the first-line empiric
treatment for acute cystitis due to its wide spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria and its
specific efficacy in the urinary tract. It has consistently demonstrated a high cure rate of over 85% for UTIs
Fosfomycin
Beta-lactam antibiotics
Chemical structure of one of the
most used fluoroquinolone -
ciprofloxacin
and a low resistance rate among E. coli strains.[4][19][20] Amoxicillin-clavulanate combination, which
enhances the effectiveness of amoxicillin, is often used as an alternative for cystitis treatment when other
options cannot be used.[21]
Fluoroquinolones are a class of antimicrobial agents known for their
high efficacy and broad spectrum activity against aerobic gram-
positive and gram-negative bacteria.[12][22] These potent antibiotics
exert their bactericidal effects by selectively inhibiting the activity of
type II DNA topoisomerases, which effectively halt the replication
of bacterial DNA, leading to bacterial death.[22]
Among the fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are
used more frequently for the treatment of UTIs. These agents are
well-absorbed orally and achieve significant concentrations in urine
and various tissues.[12] However, fluoroquinolones administration
carries risk of GI symptoms, confusion, hypersensitivity, tendinopathy, and neuropathy.[23] Additionally, the
extensive use of fluoroquinolones has contributed to the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in some
areas. As a result, fluoroquinolones are generally reserved for more serious UTIs or when there are no better
anti urinary-infective agent options.[23]
Sulfonamide is a bacteriostatic agent that competitively inhibits the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate
synthase. By acting as a substrate analog of para-aminobenzoic acid, sulfonamide inhibits folic acid
production.[24] TMP/SMX is a combination of two antibacterial agents that work synergistically to combat
a wide range of urinary tract pathogens.[25] TMP/SMX is commonly used due to its ability to achieve high
concentrations in urinary tract tissues and urine. This antibiotic combination demonstrates notable efficacy
in both the treatment and prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infections.[12] Common adverse effects
include nausea, vomiting, rash,pruritus, and photosensitivity.[26]
Kidney disease can affect drug elimination, absorption, and distribution in the body, leading to altered
serum drug concentrations. This can increase the risk of drug toxicity or suboptimal therapeutic effects. As a
result, dosage adjustments are necessary for patients who fail to achieve the desired therapeutic serum drug
levels.[27]

Sulfonamide
Renal dysfunction
Management
The choice of urinary anti-infective agents for patients with renal dysfunction is generally similar to that for
individuals with normal kidney function. However, in cases where the patient's glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) decreases to less than 20 mL/min, drug dosages adjustment is necessary because achieving the
desired therapeutic serum drug levels becomes challenging in such patients.[28]
Some drugs need to be used with caution in patients with renal dysfunction. The use of nitrofurantoin is
contraindicated in patients with an estimated GFR of less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2 as drug accumulation can
lead to increased side effects and impaired recovery of the urinary tract, increasing the risk of treatment
failure.[29] The use of TMP/SMX also raises concerns in patients with kidney disease. In patients with
creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min, the urine concentrations of SMX may decrease to subtherapeutic
levels. Therefore, in patients with low creatinine clearance, it is recommended to prescribe a reduced dosage
of TMP alone.[30]
Pregnant women with UTIs are at a higher risk of experiencing recurrent bacteriuria and developing
pyelonephritis compared to non-pregnant individuals.[31] Untreated UTIs during pregnancy can lead to
adverse outcomes, including preterm birth and low birth weight infants.[32][33]
Antimicrobial treatment should be adjusted for UTIs in pregnant women to avoid potential side effects
brought to fetus.[34] For acute cystitis and pyelonephritis in pregnant women, empiric antibiotic treatment is
often initiated. Commonly used antibiotics for uncomplicated cystitis include amoxicillin-clavulanate and
fosfomycin, while parenteral beta-lactams are preferred for acute pyelonephritis. These options are chosen
because they are considered safer in pregnancy and have a relatively broad spectrum of activity. Typically,
an antimicrobial course of five to seven days is given. This duration is chosen to minimize fetal exposure to
antimicrobials while ensuring optimal treatment outcomes.[31]
The type of urinary anti-infective agents should be carefully chosen for pregnant women with UTIs due to
the potential impact on fetal development. Penicillins, cephalosporins, and fosfomycin are safe options
during pregnancy.[35] Nitrofurantoin is typically avoided during the first trimester due to uncertain
associations with congenital anomalies.[36] TMP/SMX should also be avoided as it may be associated with
impaired folate metabolism, which increases the risk of neural tube defects.[37][38]   However, when all
alternative antibiotics are contraindicated, nitrofurantoin and TMP/SMX become the last resort at the
expense of the fetus.[39] Fluoroquinolones should be avoided during pregnancy as they are associated with
bone and cartilage toxicity in developing fetuses.[40][41][42]
Urinary tract infection in pediatric patients is a significant clinical issue, affecting approximately 7% of
fevered infants and children.[43] If left untreated, the infection can ascend from the bladder to the kidneys,
resulting in acute pyelonephritis, which leads to hypertension, kidney scarring, and end-stage kidney

disease.[44]
The choice of urinary anti-infective agents used in pediatric patients and the duration of therapy depend on
the types of UTIs they are suffering from. It is important to note that the dosage of antibiotics used in
children is typically weight-dependent. Generally, oral or parenteral cephalosporins are recommended as the
first-line agent for children older than two months.[45][46] Second-line therapy should be considered for
patients who have poor response to first-line treatment. Alternative choices include amoxicillin-clavulanate,
nitrofurantoin, TMP/SMX, and ciprofloxacin.[44]
For the treatment of simple cystitis in children, a five-day oral course of cephalexin is the preferred choice.
As for children with suspected pyelonephritis, a ten-day treatment regimen is recommended. In such cases,
a third-generation cephalosporin, such as cefdinir, is suggested as an appropriate option. If second-line
therapy is initiated in pediatric patients with suspected pyelonephritis, ciprofloxacin should be the preferred
option among the four alternatives. Nitrofurantoin may not be adequate in treating upper urinary tract
infections, while TMP/SMX and amoxicillin-clavulanate should be used with caution due to the risk of
kidney scarring in these patients.[44]
The choice of urinary anti-infective agents in pediatric patients may differ from that in adults due to the
potential harm they can cause to children. For example, the systemic use of fluoroquinolones is not
appropriate in pediatric patients due to the potential risk of musculoskeletal toxicity.[47]
The discovery of antimicrobial agents contributed significantly to UTI management during the 20th century.
Nitrofurantoin emerged as the first practical and safe urinary antimicrobial agent, but it was with limited
spectrum of activity.[48] Subsequently, in the 1970s, beta-lactam antibiotics and TMP/SMX became
available for UTI therapy.[48] Antimicrobial resistance was developed to these agents due to their
widespread and extensive usage, which restricted their clinical efficacy in UTI management.
Fluoroquinolones emerged during the 1980s and were recommended as an alternative when resistance to
TMP/SMX reaches 10% or higher.[48] The evolving landscape of drug resistance will continue to influence
the development and application of antimicrobial agents in UTI therapy.[49]
