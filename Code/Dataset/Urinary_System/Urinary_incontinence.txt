Urinary incontinence
Urinary incontinence (UI), also known as involuntary
urination, is any uncontrolled leakage of urine. It is a common and
distressing problem, which may have a large impact on quality of
life.[1] It has been identified as an important issue in geriatric health
care.[2] The term enuresis is often used to refer to urinary
incontinence primarily in children, such as nocturnal enuresis (bed
wetting).[3] UI is an example of a stigmatized medical condition,
which creates barriers to successful management and makes the
problem worse.[4] People may be too embarrassed to seek medical
help, and attempt to self-manage the symptom in secrecy from
others.
Pelvic surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause are major
risk factors.[5] Urinary incontinence is often a result of an
underlying medical condition but is under-reported to medical
practitioners.[6] There are four main types of incontinence:[7]
Urge incontinence due to an overactive bladder
Stress incontinence due to "a poorly functioning urethral
sphincter muscle (intrinsic sphincter deficiency) or to
hypermobility of the bladder neck or urethra"[8]
Overflow incontinence due to either poor bladder
contraction or blockage of the urethra
Mixed incontinence involving features of different other
types
Treatments include pelvic floor muscle training, bladder training, surgery, and electrical stimulation.[9]
Behavioral therapy generally works better than medication for stress and urge incontinence.[10] The benefit
of medications is small and long term safety is unclear.[9] Urinary incontinence is more common in older
women.[11]
Urinary incontinence can result from both urologic and non-urologic causes. Urologic causes can be
classified as either bladder dysfunction or urethral sphincter incompetence and may include detrusor
overactivity, poor bladder compliance, urethral hypermobility, or intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Non-
urologic causes may include infection, medication or drugs, psychological factors, polyuria,
hydrocephalus,[12] stool impaction, and restricted mobility.[13] The causes leading to urinary incontinence
are usually specific to each sex, however, some causes are common to both men and women.

The most common types of urinary incontinence
in women are stress urinary incontinence and urge
urinary incontinence. Women that have symptoms
of both types are said to have "mixed" urinary
incontinence. 
After 
menopause, 
estrogen
production decreases and, in some women,
urethral tissue will demonstrate atrophy, becoming
weaker and thinner, possibly playing a role in the
development of urinary incontinence.[5]
Stress urinary incontinence in women is most
commonly caused by loss of support of the
urethra, which is usually a consequence of
damage to pelvic support structures as a result of
pregnancy, 
childbirth, 
obesity, 
age, 
among
others.[14] About 33% of all women experience
urinary incontinence after giving birth, and women who deliver vaginally are about twice as likely to have
urinary incontinence as women who give birth via a Caesarean section.[15] Stress incontinence is
characterized by leaking of small amounts of urine with activities that increase abdominal pressure such as
coughing, sneezing, laughing and lifting. This happens when the urethral sphincter cannot close completely
due to the damage in the sphincter itself, or the surrounding tissue. Additionally, frequent exercise in high-
impact activities can cause athletic incontinence to develop. Urge urinary incontinence, is caused by
uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, a condition known as overactive bladder syndrome. This
type of urinary incontinence is more commonly seen in women of older age.[16] It is characterized by
leaking of large amounts of urine in association with insufficient warning to get to the bathroom in time.
Urge incontinence is the most common type of
incontinence in men.[17] Similar to women, urine
leakage happens following a very intense feeling
of urination, not allowing enough time to reach
the bathroom, a condition called overactive
bladder syndrome. In men, the condition is
commonly associated with benign prostatic
hyperplasia (an enlarged prostate), which causes
bladder outlet obstruction, a dysfunction of the
detrusor 
muscle 
(muscle 
of 
the 
bladder),
eventually causing overactive bladder syndrome,
and the associated incontinence.[17]
Stress urinary incontinence is the other common
type of incontinence in men, and it most commonly happens after prostate surgery.[18] Prostatectomy,
transurethral resection of the prostate, prostate brachytherapy, and radiotherapy can all damage the urethral
sphincter and surrounding tissue, causing it to be incompetent. An incompetent urethral sphincter cannot
prevent urine from leaking out of the urinary bladder during activities that increase the intraabdominal
Men
pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or laughing. Continence usually improves within 6 to 12 months after
prostate surgery without any specific interventions, and only 5 to 10% of people report persistent
symptoms.[17]
Age is a risk factor that increases both the severity and prevalence of UI
Polyuria (excessive urine production) of which, in turn, the most frequent causes are:
uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, primary polydipsia (excessive fluid drinking), central diabetes
insipidus and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.[19] Polyuria generally causes urinary urgency
and frequency, but does not necessarily lead to incontinence.
Neurogenic disorders like multiple sclerosis, spina bifida, Parkinson's disease, strokes and
spinal cord injury can all interfere with nerve function of the bladder.[20] This can lead to
neurogenic bladder dysfunction
Overactive bladder syndrome. However, the etiology behind this is usually different between
men and women, as mentioned above.
Other suggested risk factors include smoking, caffeine intake and depression
The body stores urine — water and wastes removed by the kidneys — in the urinary bladder, a balloon-like
organ. The bladder connects to the urethra, the tube through which urine leaves the body.[21]
Continence and micturition involve a balance between urethral closure and detrusor muscle activity (the
muscle of the bladder). During urination, detrusor muscles in the wall of the bladder contract, forcing urine
out of the bladder and into the urethra. At the same time, sphincter muscles surrounding the urethra relax,
letting urine pass out of the body. The urethral sphincter is the muscular ring that closes the outlet of the
urinary bladder preventing urine to pass outside the body. Urethral pressure normally exceeds bladder
pressure, resulting in urine remaining in the bladder, and maintaining continence.[22] The urethra is
supported by pelvic floor muscles and tissue, allowing it to close firmly. Any damage to this balance
between the detrusor muscle, urethral sphincter, supportive tissue and nerves can lead to some type of
incontinence .
For example, stress urinary incontinence is usually a result of the incompetent closure of the urethral
sphincter. This can be caused by damage to the sphincter itself, the muscles that support it, or nerves that
supply it. In men, the damage usually happens after prostate surgery or radiation,[17] and in women, it's
usually caused by childbirth and pregnancy.[23] The pressure inside the abdomen (from coughing and
sneezing) is normally transmitted to both urethra and bladder equally, leaving the pressure difference
unchanged, resulting in continence. When the sphincter is incompetent, this increase in pressure will push
the urine against it, leading to incontinence.
Both
Mechanism
Adults
Voiding dysfunction
Another example is urge incontinence. This incontinence is associated with sudden forceful contractions of
the detrusor muscle (bladder muscle), leading to an intense feeling of urination, and incontinence if the
person does not reach the bathroom on time. The syndrome is known as overactive bladder syndrome, and
it's related to dysfunction of the detrusor muscle.[24]
Urination, or voiding, is a complex activity.
The bladder is a balloon-like muscle that lies in
the lowest part of the abdomen. The bladder
stores urine and then releases it through the
urethra, which is the canal that carries urine to
the outside of the body. Controlling this
activity involves nerves, muscles, the spinal
cord and the brain.
The bladder is made of two types of muscles:
the detrusor and the sphincter. The detrusor is a
muscular sac that stores urine and squeezes to
empty. Connected to the bottom or next of the
bladder, the sphincter is a circular group of
muscles that automatically stays contracted to
hold the urine in. It will automatically relax when the detrusor contracts to let the urine into the urethra. A
third group of muscles below the bladder (pelvic floor muscles) can contract to keep urine back.
A baby's bladder fills to a set point, then automatically contracts and empties. As the child gets older, the
nervous system develops. The child's brain begins to get messages from the filling bladder and begins to
send messages to the bladder to keep it from automatically emptying until the child decides it is the time and
place to void.
Failures in this control mechanism result in incontinence. Reasons for this failure range from the simple to
the complex.
The pattern of voiding and urine leakage is important as it suggests the type of incontinence. Other points
include straining and discomfort, use of drugs, recent surgery, and illness.
The physical examination looks for signs of medical conditions causing incontinence, such as tumors that
block the urinary tract, stool impaction, and poor reflexes or sensations, which may be evidence of a nerve-
related cause.
Other tests include:[25]
Stress test – the patient relaxes, then coughs vigorously as the doctor watches for loss of
urine.
Urinalysis – urine is tested for evidence of infection, urinary stones, or other contributing
causes.
Children
Diagnosis
Ultrasound of the urinary bladder of an 85-year-old
man. It shows a trabeculated wall, which is a sign of
urinary retention.
Blood tests – blood is taken, sent to a
laboratory, and examined for substances
related to causes of incontinence.
Ultrasound – sound waves are used to
visualize the kidneys and urinary bladder,
assess the capacity of the bladder before
voiding, and the remaining amount of urine
after voiding. This helps know if there's a
problem in emptying.
Cystoscopy – a thin tube with a tiny camera
is inserted in the urethra and used to see the
inside of the urethra and bladder.
Urodynamics – various techniques measure
pressure in the bladder and the flow of
urine.
People are often asked to keep a diary for a day or
more, up to a week, to record the pattern of voiding,
noting times and the amounts of urine produced.
Research projects that assess the efficacy of anti-incontinence therapies often quantify the extent of urinary
incontinence. The methods include the 1-h pad test, measuring leakage volume; using a voiding diary,
counting the number of incontinence episodes (leakage episodes) per day; and assessing of the strength of
pelvic floor muscles, measuring the maximum vaginal squeeze pressure.
There are 4 main types of urinary incontinence:
1. Stress incontinence, also known as effort incontinence, is essentially due to incomplete
closure of the urinary sphincter, due to problems in the sphincter itself or insufficient strength
of the pelvic floor muscles supporting it. This type of incontinence is when urine leaks during
activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing or bearing
down.[26]
2. Urge incontinence is an involuntary loss of urine occurring while suddenly feeling the need
or urge to urinate, usually secondary to overactive bladder syndrome.
3. Overflow incontinence is the incontinence that happens suddenly without feeling the urge to
urinate and without necessarily doing any physical activities. It is also known as under-active
bladder syndrome. This usually happens with chronic obstruction of the bladder outlet or
with diseases damaging the nerves supplying the urinary bladder. The urine stretches the
bladder without the person feeling the pressure, and eventually, it overwhelms the ability of
the urethral sphincter to hold it back.[27]
4. Mixed incontinence contains symptoms of multiple other types of incontinence. It is not
uncommon in the elderly female population and can sometimes be complicated by urinary
retention.
Functional incontinence occurs when a person recognizes the need to urinate but cannot
make it to the bathroom. The loss of urine may be large. There are several causes of
functional incontinence including confusion, dementia, poor eyesight, mobility or dexterity,
Main types
Other types
unwillingness to use the toilet because of depression or anxiety or inebriation due to
alcohol.[28] Functional incontinence can also occur in certain circumstances where no
biological or medical problem is present. For example, a person may recognize the need to
urinate but may be in a situation where there is no toilet nearby or access to a toilet is
restricted.
Structural incontinence: Rarely, structural problems can cause incontinence, usually
diagnosed in childhood (for example, an ectopic ureter). Fistulas caused by obstetric and
gynecologic trauma or injury are commonly known as obstetric fistulas and can lead to
incontinence. These types of vaginal fistulas include, most commonly, vesicovaginal fistula
and, more rarely, ureterovaginal fistula. These may be difficult to diagnose. The use of
standard techniques along with a vaginogram or radiologically viewing the vaginal vault with
instillation of contrast media.[29]
Nocturnal enuresis is episodic UI while asleep. It is normal in young children.
Transient incontinence is temporary incontinence most often seen in pregnant women when
it subsequently resolves after the birth of the child.[30]
Giggle incontinence is an involuntary response to laughter. It usually affects children.
Double incontinence. There is also a related condition for defecation known as fecal
incontinence. Due to involvement of the same muscle group (levator ani) in bladder and
bowel continence, patients with urinary incontinence are more likely to have fecal
incontinence in addition.[31] This is sometimes termed "double incontinence".
Post-void dribbling is the phenomenon where urine remaining in the urethra after voiding the
bladder slowly leaks out after urination.
Coital incontinence (CI) is urinary leakage that occurs during either penetration or orgasm
and can occur with a sexual partner or with masturbation. It has been reported to occur in
10% to 24% of sexually active women with pelvic floor disorders.[32]
Climacturia is urinary incontinence at the moment of orgasm. It can be a result of radical
prostatectomy.
Yearly screening is recommended for women by the Women's Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI) and
people who test positive in the screening process would need to be referred for further testing to understand
how to help treat their condition.[33][34] Screening questions should inquire about what symptoms they
have experienced, how severe the symptoms are, and if the symptoms affect their daily lives.[33] As of
2018, studies have not shown a change in outcomes with urinary incontinence screenings in women.[35]
Treatment options include conservative treatment, behavioral therapy, bladder retraining,[36] pelvic floor
therapy, collecting devices (for men), fixer-occluder devices for incontinence (in men), medications, and
surgery.[37] Both nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments may be effective for treating UI in
non-pregnant women.[16] All treatments, except hormones and periurethral bulking agents, are more
effective than no treatment in improving or curing UI symptoms or achieving patient satisfaction.[16][38]
Behavioral therapy involves the use of both suppressive techniques (distraction, relaxation) and learning to
avoid foods that may worsen urinary incontinence. This may involve avoiding or limiting consumption of
caffeine and alcohol. Behavioral therapies, including bladder training, biofeedback, and pelvic floor muscle
Screening
Management
Behavioral therapy, physical therapy and exercise
training, are most effective for improving urinary incontinence in women, with a low risk of adverse
events.[39][38][40][16] Behavioral therapy is not curative for urinary incontinence, but it can improve a
person's quality of life. Behavioral therapy has benefits as both a monotherapy (behaviorial therapy alone)
and as an adjunct to medications (combining different therapies) for symptom reduction.[41] Time voiding
while urinating and bladder training are techniques that use biofeedback. In time voiding, the patient fills in
a chart of voiding and leaking. From the patterns that appear in the chart, the patient can plan to empty his
or her bladder before he or she would otherwise leak.[16] Biofeedback and muscle conditioning, known as
bladder training, can alter the bladder's schedule for storing and emptying urine. These techniques are
effective for urge and overflow incontinence.[42]
Avoiding heavy lifting and preventing constipation may help with uncontrollable urine leakage. Stopping
smoking is also recommended as it is associated with improvements in urinary incontinence in men and
women.[43] Weight loss may also be helpful for people who are overweight to improve symptoms of
incontinence.[44][45][38]
Physical therapy can be effective for women in reducing urinary incontinence.[46] Pelvic floor physical
therapists work with patients to identify and treat underlying pelvic muscle dysfunction that can cease
urinary incontinence. They may recommend exercises to strengthen the muscles, electrostimulation, or
biofeedback treatments.[47][48] Exercising the muscles of the pelvis such as with Kegel exercises are a first
line treatment for women with stress incontinence.[44] Efforts to increase the time between urination, known
as bladder training, is recommended in those with urge incontinence.[44] Both these may be used in those
with mixed incontinence.[44]
Physical therapy, both by itself and in combination with anticholinergic drugs, was found to be more
successful in reducing urinary incontinence in women than anticholinergics by themselves.[16]
Small vaginal cones of increasing weight may be used to help with exercise.[49][50] They seem to be better
than no active treatment in women with stress urinary incontinence, and have similar effects to training of
pelvic floor muscles or electrostimulation.[50]
Biofeedback uses measuring devices to help the patient become aware of his or her body's functioning. By
using electronic devices or diaries to track when the bladder and urethral muscles contract, the patient can
gain control over these muscles. Biofeedback can be used with pelvic muscle exercises and electrical
stimulation to relieve stress and urge incontinence. The evidence supporting the role for biofeedback
devices in treating urinary incontinence is mixed.[51] There is some very weak evidence that electrical
stimulation that is low in frequency may be helpful in combination with other standard treatments for
women with overactive bladder condition,[52] however, the evidence supporting a role for biofeedback
combined with pelvic floor muscle training is very weak and likely indicates that biofeedback-assistance is
not helpful when included with conservative treatments for overactive bladder.[51]
Preoperative pelvic floor muscle training in men undergoing radical prostatectomy was not effective in
reducing urinary incontinence.[18]
Example of a foley

Different types of pessaries. These are inserted inside
the vagina for support.
Alternative exercises have been studied for stress urinary incontinence in women.[53] Evidence was
insufficient to support the use of Paula method, abdominal muscle training, Pilates, Tai chi, breathing
exercises, postural training, and generalized fitness.[53]
Individuals who continue to experience urinary incontinence need to find a
management solution that matches their individual situation. The use of
mechanical devices has not been well studied in women, as of 2014.[54]
Collecting systems (for men) – consists of a sheath worn over the
penis funneling the urine into a urine bag worn on the leg. These
products come in a variety of materials and sizes for individual fit.
Studies[55] show that urisheaths and urine bags are preferred over
absorbent products – in particular when it comes to 'limitations to
daily activities'. Solutions exist for all levels of incontinence.
Advantages with collecting systems are that they are discreet, the
skin stays dry all the time, and they are convenient to use both day
and night. Disadvantages are that it is necessary to get measured to
ensure proper fit, and in some countries, a prescription is needed.
Absorbent products (include shields, incontinence pads,
undergarments, protective underwear, briefs, diapers, adult diapers
and underpants) are the best-known product types to manage
incontinence. They are widely available in pharmacies and
supermarkets. The advantages of using these are that they barely
need any fitting or introduction by a healthcare specialist. The disadvantages with absorbent
products are that they can be bulky, leak, have odors and can cause skin breakdown due to
the constant dampness.
Intermittent catheters are single-use catheters that are inserted into the bladder to empty it,
and once the bladder is empty they are removed and discarded. Intermittent catheters are
primarily used for urinary retention (inability to empty the bladder), but for some people they
can be used to reduce or avoid incontinence. These are prescription-only medical devices.
Indwelling catheters (also known as
foleys) are often used in hospital settings,
or if the user is not able to handle any of
the above solutions himself/herself (e.g.
severe neurologic injury or
neurodegenerative disease). These are
also prescription-only medical devices.
The indwelling catheter is typically
connected to a urine bag that can be worn
on the leg or hung on the side of the bed.
Indwelling catheters need to be monitored
and changed on a regular basis by a
healthcare professional. The advantage of
indwelling catheters is that because the
urine is funneled away from the body, the
skin remains dry. However, the
disadvantage is that it is very common to
incur urinary tract infections when using
indwelling catheters. Bladder spasms and other problems can also occur with long-term use
of indwelling catheters.[56]
Devices
Penis clamp (or penis compression device), which is applied to compress the urethra to
compensate for the malfunctioning of the natural urinary sphincter, preventing leakage from
the bladder.[57] This management solution is only suitable for light or moderate incontinence.
Vaginal pessaries for women are devices inserted into the vagina. This device provides
support to the urethra which passes right in front of it, allowing it to close more firmly.
A number of medications exist to treat urinary incontinence including: fesoterodine, tolterodine and
oxybutynin.[58] These medications work by relaxing smooth muscle in the bladder.[59][60][61] While some
of these medications appear to have a small benefit, the risk of side effects are a concern.[58] Medications
are effective for about one in ten people, and all medications have similar efficacy.[58]
Medications are not recommended for those with stress incontinence and are only recommended in those
with urge incontinence who do not improve with bladder training.[44]
Injectable bulking agents may be used to enhance urethral support, however, they are of unclear
benefit.[62][63]
Women and men that have persistent incontinence despite optimal conservative therapy may be candidates
for surgery. Surgery may be used to help stress or overflow incontinence.[7] Common surgical techniques
for stress incontinence include slings, tension-free vaginal tape, bladder suspension, artificial urinary
sphincters, among others.[7] It is not clear if antibiotics taken prophylactically after surgery are helpful at
decreasing the risk of an infection after surgery.[64]
The use of transvaginal mesh implants and bladder slings is controversial due to the risk of debilitating
painful side effects such as vaginal erosion.[65] In 2012 transvaginal mesh implants were classified as a high
risk device by the US Food and Drug Administration.[66] Urodynamic testing seems to confirm that surgical
restoration of vault prolapse can cure motor urge incontinence.
Traditional suburethral sling operations are probably slightly better than open abdominal retropubic
colposuspension and are probably slightly less effective than mid-urethral sling operations in reducing
urinary incontinence in women, but it is still uncertain if any of the different types of traditional suburethral
sling operations are better than others.[67] Similarly, there is insufficient long term evidence to be certain
about the effectiveness or safety of single-incision sling operations for urinary incontinence in women.[68]
Traditional suburethral slings may have a higher risk of surgical complications than minimally invasive
slings but the risk of complications compared with other types of operation is still uncertain.[67]
Laparoscopic colposuspension (keyhole surgery through the abdomen) with sutures is as effective as open
colposuspension for curing incontinence in women up to 18 months after surgery, but it is unclear whether
there are fewer risk of complications during or after surgery.[69] There is probably a higher risk of
complications with traditional suburethral slings than with open abdominal retropubic suspension.[69]
The artificial urinary sphincter is an implantable device used to treat stress incontinence, mostly in men. The
device is made of 2 or 3 parts: The pump, cuff, and balloon reservoir connected to each other by specialized
tubes. The cuff wraps around the urethra and closes it. When the person wants to urinate, he presses the
Medications
Surgery
AMS 800 and ZSI 375 artificial urinary
sphincters
pump (implanted in the scrotum), to deflate the cuff, and allow
the urine to pass. The cuff regains pressure within a few
minutes to regain continence.[70] The European Association of
Urology considers the artificial urinary sphincter as the gold
standard in surgical management of stress urinary incontinence
in men after prostatectomy.[71]
Globally, up to 35% of the population over the age of 60 years
is estimated to be incontinent.[72] In 2014, urinary leakage
affected between 30% and 40% of people over 65 years of age
living in their own homes or apartments in the U.S.[73] Twenty-four percent of older adults in the U.S. have
moderate or severe urinary incontinence that should be treated medically.[73] People with dementia are three
times more likely to have urinary incontinence compared to people of similar ages.[74][75]
Bladder control problems have been found to be associated with higher incidence of many other health
problems such as obesity and diabetes. Difficulty with bladder control results in higher rates of depression
and limited activity levels.[76]
Incontinence is expensive both to individuals in the form of bladder control products and to the health care
system and nursing home industry. Injury-related to incontinence is a leading cause of admission to assisted
living and nursing care facilities. In 1997 more than 50% of nursing facility admissions were related to
incontinence.[77]
Approximately 17% of non-pregnant women have urinary incontinence, with the most common types being
stress, urgency, and mixed.[78] Bladder symptoms affect women of all ages. However, bladder problems are
most prevalent among older women.[79] Women over the age of 60 years are twice as likely as men to
experience incontinence; one in three women over the age of 60 years are estimated to have bladder control
problems.[72] One reason why women are more affected is the weakening of pelvic floor muscles by
pregnancy.[80]
Men tend to experience incontinence less often than women, and the structure of the male urinary tract
accounts for this difference. Stress incontinence is common after prostate cancer treatments.
While urinary incontinence affects older men more often than younger men, the onset of incontinence can
happen at any age. Estimates around 2007 suggested that 17 percent of men over age 60, an estimated
600,000 men in the US, experienced urinary incontinence, with this percentage increasing with age.[81]
Epidemiology
Women
Men
Children
Incontinence happens less often after age 5: About 10 percent of 5-year-olds, 5 percent of 10-year-olds, and
1 percent of 18-year-olds experience episodes of incontinence. It is twice as common in girls as in boys.[82]
The management of urinary incontinence with pads is mentioned in the earliest medical book known, the
Ebers Papyrus (1500 BC).[83]
Incontinence has historically been a taboo subject in Western culture. However, this situation changed some
when Kimberly-Clark aggressively marketed adult diapers in the 1980s with actor June Allyson as
spokeswoman. Allyson was initially reticent to participate, but her mother, who had incontinence,
convinced her that it was her duty in light of her successful career. The product proved a success.[84]
The case Hiltibran et al v. Levy et al in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri
resulted in that court issuing an order in 2011. That order requires incontinence briefs funded by Medicaid
to be given by Missouri to adults who would be institutionalized without them.[85][86]
The effectiveness of different therapeutic approaches to treating urinary incontinence is not well studied for
some medical conditions. For example, for people who experience urinary incontinence due to stroke,
treatment approaches such as physical therapy, cognitive therapy, complementary medicine, and specialized
interventions with experienced medical professionals are sometimes suggested, however it is not clear how
effective these are at improving incontinence and there is no strong medical evidence to guide clinical
practice.[20]
