Parathyroid gland
Parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands in the neck of
humans and other tetrapods. Humans usually have four
parathyroid glands, located on the back of the thyroid gland in
variable locations. The parathyroid gland produces and secretes
parathyroid hormone in response to low blood calcium, which
plays a key role in regulating the amount of calcium in the
blood and within the bones.
Parathyroid glands share a similar blood supply, venous
drainage, and lymphatic drainage to the thyroid glands.
Parathyroid glands are derived from the epithelial lining of the
third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, with the superior glands
arising from the fourth pouch and the inferior glands arising
from the higher third pouch. The relative position of the inferior
and superior glands, which are named according to their final
location, changes because of the migration of embryological
tissues.
Hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism, characterized by
alterations in the blood calcium levels and bone metabolism, are
states of either surplus or deficient parathyroid function.
The parathyroid glands are two pairs of glands usually
positioned behind the left and right lobes of the thyroid. Each
gland is a yellowish-brown flat ovoid that resembles a lentil
seed, usually about 6 mm long and 3 to 4 mm wide, and 1 to
2 mm anteroposteriorly.[1] There are typically four parathyroid
glands. The two parathyroid glands on each side which are
positioned higher are called the superior parathyroid glands,
while the lower two are called the inferior parathyroid glands.
Healthy parathyroid glands generally weigh about 30  mg in
men and 35 mg in women.[2] These glands are not visible or
able to be felt during examination of the neck.[3]

Each parathyroid vein drains into the superior, middle and
inferior thyroid veins. The superior and middle thyroid veins
drain into the internal jugular vein, and the inferior thyroid vein
drains into the brachiocephalic vein.[4]
Lymphatic vessels from the parathyroid glands drain into deep
cervical lymph nodes and paratracheal lymph nodes.[4]
The parathyroid glands are variable in number: three or more
small glands,[5] and can usually be located on the posterior
surface of the thyroid gland.[5] Occasionally, some individuals
may have six, eight, or even more parathyroid glands.[3] Rarely,
the parathyroid glands may be within the thyroid gland itself,
the chest, or even the thymus.[5]
The parathyroid glands are named for their proximity to the
thyroid—and serve a completely different role than the thyroid
gland. The parathyroid glands are quite easily recognizable
from the thyroid as they have densely packed cells, in contrast
with the follicular structure of the thyroid.[6] Two unique types
of cells are present in the parathyroid gland:
Chief cells, which synthesize and release
parathyroid hormone. These cells are small, and
appear dark when loaded with parathyroid hormone,
and clear when the hormone has been secreted, or in
their resting state.[7]
Oxyphil cells, which are lighter in appearance and
increase in number with age,[7] have an unknown
function.[8]

In the early development of the human embryo, a series of five pharyngeal arches and four pharyngeal
pouches form that give rise to the face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such
that the first pouch is the closest to the top of the embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The
parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural
crest mesenchyme.[5] The position of the glands reverses during embryological development. The pair of
glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the thymus, whereas the pair of
glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development,
the thymus migrates downwards, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged
downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not
embryological, positions.[9] Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is
occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the chest cavity if
they fail to detach in the neck.
Development

hyperparathyroidism (right)
Parathyroid development is regulated by a number of genes, including those coding for several transcription
factors.[10][a]
The major function of the parathyroid glands is to maintain the body's calcium and phosphate levels within
a very narrow range, so that the nervous and muscular systems can function properly. The parathyroid
glands do this by secreting parathyroid hormone (PTH).[11]
Parathyroid hormone (also known as parathormone) is a small protein that takes part in the control of
calcium and phosphate homeostasis, as well as bone physiology. Parathyroid hormone has effects
antagonistic to those of calcitonin.[12]
Calcium. PTH increases blood calcium levels by directly stimulating osteoblasts and
thereby indirectly stimulating osteoclasts (through RANK/RANKL mechanism) to break down
bone and release calcium. PTH increases gastrointestinal calcium absorption by activating
vitamin D, and promotes calcium conservation (reabsorption) by the kidneys.[12]
Phosphate. PTH is the major regulator of serum phosphate concentrations via actions on
the kidney. It is an inhibitor of proximal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus. Through
activation of vitamin D the absorption (intestinal) of Phosphate is increased.[12]
Parathyroid disease is conventionally divided into states where the parathyroid is overactive
(hyperparathyroidism), and states where the parathyroid is under- or hypoactive (hypoparathyroidism). Both
states are characterised by their symptoms, which relate to the excess or deficiency of parathyroid hormone
in the blood.[13]
Hyperparathyroidism is the state in which there is excess
parathyroid hormone circulating in the blood. This may cause bone
pain and tenderness, due to increased bone resorption. With
increased circulating calcium, there may be other symptoms
associated with hypercalcemia, most commonly dehydration.
Hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a benign
proliferation of chief cells in one parathyroid gland, and rarely in
MEN 
syndrome. 
This 
is 
known 
as 
primary
hyperparathyroidism,[13] which is generally managed by surgical
removal of the abnormal parathyroid gland.[14]
Renal disease may lead to hyperparathyroidism. When too much calcium is lost from the blood via
urination, there is a compensation by the parathyroid, and parathyroid hormone is released. The glands
enlarge (hypertrophy) to synthesize more parathyroid hormone. This is known as secondary
Function
Disorders
Hyperparathyroidism
Primary
Secondary
hyperparathyroidism.
If secondary hyperparathyroidism persists over months, the parathyroid tissue may become unresponsive to
the blood calcium levels, and begin to autonomously release parathyroid hormone. This is known as tertiary
hyperparathyroidism.[15]
The state of decreased parathyroid activity is known as hypoparathyroidism. This is most commonly
associated with damage to the glands or their blood supply during thyroid surgery – it may be associated
with rarer genetic syndromes such as DiGeorge syndrome, which is inherited as an autosomal dominant
syndrome. Hypoparathyroidism will occur after surgical removal of the parathyroid glands.[16]
Occasionally, an individual's tissues are resistant to the effects of parathyroid hormone. This is known as
pseudohypoparathyroidism. In this case the parathyroid glands are fully functional, and the hormone itself is
not able to function, resulting in a decrease in blood calcium levels. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is often
associated 
with 
the 
genetic 
condition 
Albright's 
hereditary 
osteodystrophy. 
Pseudo-
pseudohypoparathyroidism, one of the longest words in the English language, is used to describe an
individual with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy with normal parathyroid hormone and serum calcium
levels.[16]
Hypoparathyroidism may present with symptoms associated with decreased calcium, and is generally
treated with Vitamin D analogues.[16]
The parathyroid glands were first discovered in the Indian rhinoceros by Richard Owen in 1852.[17] In his
description of the neck anatomy, Owen referred to the glands as "a small compact yellow glandular body
attached to the thyroid at the point where the veins emerged". The glands were first discovered in humans
by Ivar Viktor Sandström (1852–1889), a Swedish medical student, in 1880 at Uppsala University.[18]
Unaware of Owen's description, he described the glands in his monograph "On a New Gland in Man and
Fellow Animals" as the "glandulae parathyroidae", noting its existence in dogs, cats, rabbits, oxen, horses
and humans.[19][20] For several years, Sandström's description received little attention.[21]
Eugene Gley, Giulio Vassale, and others documented the putative function of the glands in 1891, noting the
connection between their removal and the development of muscular tetany. William G. MacCallum in 1908,
investigating tumours of the parathyroid, proposed their role in calcium metabolism.[20] He noted that
"Tetany occurs spontaneously in many forms and may be produced by the destruction of the parathyroid
glands".[22]
The first successful removal of the parathyroid may have been carried out in 1928 by medical doctor Isaac
Y Olch, whose intern had noticed elevated calcium levels in an elderly patient with muscle weakness. Prior
to this surgery, patients with removed parathyroid glands typically died from muscular tetany.[20]
Tertiary
Hypoparathyroidism
History
Parathyroid hormone was isolated in 1923 by Adolph M. Hanson and 1925 by James B. Collip. Studies of
parathyroid hormone levels by Roger Guillemin, Andrew Schally and Rosalyn Sussman Yalow led to the
development of immunoassays capable of measuring body substances and a Nobel Prize in 1977.[18][20]
Parathyroid glands are found in all adult tetrapods; they vary in their number and position. Mammals
typically have four parathyroid glands, while other types of animals typically have six. The removal of
parathyroid glands in animals produces a condition resembling acute poisoning with irregular muscle
contractions.[23]
Fish do not possess parathyroid glands; several species have been found to express parathyroid hormone.
Developmental genes and calcium-sensing receptors in fish gills are similar to those within the parathyroid
glands of birds and mammals. It has been suggested that the tetrapod glands may have been evolutionarily
derived from these fish gills.[10][24]
