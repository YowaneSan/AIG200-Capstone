Hypothalamus
The hypothalamus (pl.: hypothalami; from Ancient Greek
ὑπό (hupó)  'under', and θάλαμος (thálamos)  'chamber') is a
small part of the brain that contains a number of nuclei with a
variety of functions. One of the most important functions is to
link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary
gland. The hypothalamus is located below the thalamus and is
part of the limbic system.[1] It forms the ventral part of the
diencephalon. All vertebrate brains contain a hypothalamus.[2]
In humans, it is the size of an almond.
The hypothalamus is responsible for regulating certain
metabolic processes and other activities of the autonomic
nervous 
system. 
It 
synthesizes 
and 
secretes 
certain
neurohormones, called releasing hormones or hypothalamic
hormones, and these in turn stimulate or inhibit the secretion of
hormones from the pituitary gland. The hypothalamus controls
body temperature, hunger, important aspects of parenting and
maternal attachment behaviours, thirst,[3] fatigue, sleep,
circadian rhythms, and is important in certain social behaviors,
such as sexual and aggressive behaviors.[4][5]
The hypothalamus is divided into four regions (preoptic,
supraoptic, tuberal, mammillary) in a parasagittal plane,
indicating 
location 
anterior-posterior; 
and 
three 
zones
(periventricular, intermediate, lateral) in the coronal plane,
indicating location medial-lateral.[6] Hypothalamic nuclei are
located within these specific regions and zones.[7] It is found in
all vertebrate nervous systems. In mammals, magnocellular
neurosecretory cells in the paraventricular nucleus and the
supraoptic 
nucleus 
of 
the 
hypothalamus 
produce
neurohypophysial hormones, oxytocin and vasopressin.[8]
These hormones are released into the blood in the posterior
pituitary.[9] Much smaller parvocellular neurosecretory cells,
neurons of the paraventricular nucleus, release corticotropin-

The hypothalamus is highly interconnected with other parts of the central nervous system, in particular the
brainstem and its reticular formation. As part of the limbic system, it has connections to other limbic
structures including the amygdala and septum, and is also connected with areas of the autonomous nervous
system.
The hypothalamus receives many inputs from the brainstem, the most notable from the nucleus of the
solitary tract, the locus coeruleus, and the ventrolateral medulla.
Most nerve fibres within the hypothalamus run in two ways (bidirectional).
Projections to areas caudal to the hypothalamus go through the medial forebrain bundle, the
mammillotegmental tract and the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus.
Projections to areas rostral to the hypothalamus are carried by the mammillothalamic tract,
the fornix and terminal stria.
Connections
Projections to areas of the sympathetic motor system (lateral horn spinal segments T1–
L2/L3) are carried by the hypothalamospinal tract and they activate the sympathetic motor
pathway.
Several hypothalamic nuclei are sexually dimorphic; i.e., there are clear differences in both structure and
function between males and females.[16] Some differences are apparent even in gross neuroanatomy: most
notable is the sexually dimorphic nucleus within the preoptic area,[16] in which the differences are subtle
changes in the connectivity and chemical sensitivity of particular sets of neurons. The importance of these
changes can be recognized by functional differences between males and females. For instance, males of
most species prefer the odor and appearance of females over males, which is instrumental in stimulating
male sexual behavior. If the sexually dimorphic nucleus is lesioned, this preference for females by males
diminishes. Also, the pattern of secretion of growth hormone is sexually dimorphic;[17] this is why in many
species, adult males are visibly distinct sizes from females.
Other striking functional dimorphisms are in the behavioral responses to ovarian steroids of the adult. Males
and females respond to ovarian steroids in different ways, partly because the expression of estrogen-
sensitive neurons in the hypothalamus is sexually dimorphic; i.e., estrogen receptors are expressed in
different sets of neurons.
Estrogen and progesterone can influence gene expression in particular neurons or induce changes in cell
membrane potential and kinase activation, leading to diverse non-genomic cellular functions. Estrogen and
progesterone bind to their cognate nuclear hormone receptors, which translocate to the cell nucleus and
interact with regions of DNA known as hormone response elements (HREs) or get tethered to another
transcription factor's binding site. Estrogen receptor (ER) has been shown to transactivate other transcription
factors in this manner, despite the absence of an estrogen response element (ERE) in the proximal promoter
region of the gene. In general, ERs and progesterone receptors (PRs) are gene activators, with increased
mRNA and subsequent protein synthesis following hormone exposure.
Male and female brains differ in the distribution of estrogen receptors, and this difference is an irreversible
consequence of neonatal steroid exposure. Estrogen receptors (and progesterone receptors) are found
mainly in neurons in the anterior and mediobasal hypothalamus, notably:
the preoptic area (where LHRH neurons are located, regulating dopamine responses and
maternal behavior;[18]
the periventricular nucleus where somatostatin neurons are located, regulating stress
levels;[19]
the ventromedial hypothalamus which regulates hunger and sexual arousal.
In neonatal life, gonadal steroids influence the development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. For
instance, they determine the ability of females to exhibit a normal reproductive cycle, and of males and
females to display appropriate reproductive behaviors in adult life.

Endocrine glands in the human head

If a female rat is injected once with testosterone in the
first few days of postnatal life (during the "critical period"
of sex-steroid influence), the hypothalamus is irreversibly
masculinized; the adult rat will be incapable of
generating an LH surge in response to estrogen (a
characteristic of females), but will be capable of
exhibiting male sexual behaviors (mounting a sexually
receptive female).[20]
By contrast, a male rat castrated just after birth will be
feminized, and the adult will show female sexual
behavior in response to estrogen (sexual receptivity,
lordosis behavior).[20]
In primates, the developmental influence of androgens is less clear,
and the consequences are less understood. Within the brain,
testosterone is aromatized (to estradiol), which is the principal active
hormone for developmental influences. The human testis secretes
high levels of testosterone from about week 8 of fetal life until 5–6
months after birth (a similar perinatal surge in testosterone is
observed in many species), a process that appears to underlie the male phenotype. Estrogen from the
maternal circulation is relatively ineffective, partly because of the high circulating levels of steroid-binding
proteins in pregnancy.[20]
Sex steroids are not the only important influences upon hypothalamic development; in particular, pre-
pubertal stress in early life (of rats) determines the capacity of the adult hypothalamus to respond to an acute
stressor.[21] Unlike gonadal steroid receptors, glucocorticoid receptors are very widespread throughout the
brain; in the paraventricular nucleus, they mediate negative feedback control of CRF synthesis and
secretion, but elsewhere their role is not well understood.
The hypothalamus has a central neuroendocrine function, most
notably by its control of the anterior pituitary, which in turn
regulates various endocrine glands and organs. Releasing hormones
(also called releasing factors) are produced in hypothalamic nuclei
then transported along axons to either the median eminence or the
posterior pituitary, where they are stored and released as needed.[22]
Anterior pituitary
In the hypothalamic–adenohypophyseal axis, releasing hormones,
also known as hypophysiotropic or hypothalamic hormones, are released from the median eminence, a
prolongation of the hypothalamus, into the hypophyseal portal system, which carries them to the anterior
pituitary where they exert their regulatory functions on the secretion of adenohypophyseal hormones.[23]
These hypophysiotropic hormones are stimulated by parvocellular neurosecretory cells located in the
periventricular area of the hypothalamus. After their release into the capillaries of the third ventricle, the
hypophysiotropic hormones travel through what is known as the hypothalamo-pituitary portal circulation.
Function
Hormone release
Once they reach their destination in the anterior pituitary, these hormones bind to specific receptors located
on the surface of pituitary cells. Depending on which cells are activated through this binding, the pituitary
will either begin secreting or stop secreting hormones into the rest of the bloodstream.[24]

It is also known that hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA) hormones are related to certain skin
diseases and skin homeostasis. There is evidence linking hyperactivity of HPA hormones to stress-related
skin diseases and skin tumors.[30]
The hypothalamus coordinates many hormonal and behavioural circadian rhythms, complex patterns of
neuroendocrine outputs, complex homeostatic mechanisms, and important behaviours. The hypothalamus
must, therefore, respond to many different signals, some of which are generated externally and some
internally. Delta wave signalling arising either in the thalamus or in the cortex influences the secretion of
releasing hormones; GHRH and prolactin are stimulated whilst TRH is inhibited.
The hypothalamus is responsive to:
Light: daylength and photoperiod for regulating circadian and seasonal rhythms
Olfactory stimuli, including pheromones
Steroids, including gonadal steroids and corticosteroids
Neurally transmitted information arising in particular from the heart, enteric nervous system
(of the gastrointestinal tract),[31] and the reproductive tract.
Autonomic inputs
Blood-borne stimuli, including leptin, ghrelin, angiotensin, insulin, pituitary hormones,
cytokines, plasma concentrations of glucose and osmolarity etc.

Olfactory stimuli are important for sexual reproduction and neuroendocrine function in many species. For
instance if a pregnant mouse is exposed to the urine of a 'strange' male during a critical period after coitus
then the pregnancy fails (the Bruce effect). Thus, during coitus, a female mouse forms a precise 'olfactory

memory' of her partner that persists for several days. Pheromonal cues aid synchronization of oestrus in
many species; in women, synchronized menstruation may also arise from pheromonal cues, although the
role of pheromones in humans is disputed.
Peptide hormones have important influences upon the hypothalamus, and to do so they must pass through
the blood–brain barrier. The hypothalamus is bounded in part by specialized brain regions that lack an
effective blood–brain barrier; the capillary endothelium at these sites is fenestrated to allow free passage of
even large proteins and other molecules. Some of these sites are the sites of neurosecretion - the
neurohypophysis and the median eminence. However, others are sites at which the brain samples the
composition of the blood. Two of these sites, the SFO (subfornical organ) and the OVLT (organum
vasculosum of the lamina terminalis) are so-called circumventricular organs, where neurons are in intimate
contact with both blood and CSF. These structures are densely vascularized, and contain osmoreceptive and
sodium-receptive neurons that control drinking, vasopressin release, sodium excretion, and sodium appetite.
They also contain neurons with receptors for angiotensin, atrial natriuretic factor, endothelin and relaxin,
each of which important in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance. Neurons in the OVLT and SFO
project to the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, and also to preoptic hypothalamic areas. The
circumventricular organs may also be the site of action of interleukins to elicit both fever and ACTH
secretion, via effects on paraventricular neurons.
It is not clear how all peptides that influence hypothalamic activity gain the necessary access. In the case of
prolactin and leptin, there is evidence of active uptake at the choroid plexus from the blood into the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Some pituitary hormones have a negative feedback influence upon hypothalamic
secretion; for example, growth hormone feeds back on the hypothalamus, but how it enters the brain is not
clear. There is also evidence for central actions of prolactin.
Findings have suggested that thyroid hormone (T4) is taken up by the hypothalamic glial cells in the
infundibular nucleus/ median eminence, and that it is here converted into T3 by the type 2 deiodinase (D2).
Subsequent to this, T3 is transported into the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-producing neurons in
the paraventricular nucleus. Thyroid hormone receptors have been found in these neurons, indicating that
they are indeed sensitive to T3 stimuli. In addition, these neurons expressed MCT8, a thyroid hormone
transporter, supporting the theory that T3 is transported into them. T3 could then bind to the thyroid
hormone receptor in these neurons and affect the production of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, thereby
regulating thyroid hormone production.[32]
The hypothalamus functions as a type of thermostat for the body.[33] It sets a desired body temperature, and
stimulates either heat production and retention to raise the blood temperature to a higher setting or sweating
and vasodilation to cool the blood to a lower temperature. All fevers result from a raised setting in the
hypothalamus; elevated body temperatures due to any other cause are classified as hyperthermia.[33] Rarely,
direct damage to the hypothalamus, such as from a stroke, will cause a fever; this is sometimes called a
hypothalamic fever. However, it is more common for such damage to cause abnormally low body
temperatures.[33]
Blood-borne stimuli
Steroids
The hypothalamus contains neurons that react strongly to steroids and glucocorticoids (the steroid hormones
of the adrenal gland, released in response to ACTH). It also contains specialized glucose-sensitive neurons
(in the arcuate nucleus and ventromedial hypothalamus), which are important for appetite. The preoptic area
contains thermosensitive neurons; these are important for TRH secretion.
Oxytocin secretion in response to suckling or vagino-cervical stimulation is mediated by some of these
pathways; vasopressin secretion in response to cardiovascular stimuli arising from chemoreceptors in the
carotid body and aortic arch, and from low-pressure atrial volume receptors, is mediated by others. In the
rat, stimulation of the vagina also causes prolactin secretion, and this results in pseudo-pregnancy following
an infertile mating. In the rabbit, coitus elicits reflex ovulation. In the sheep, cervical stimulation in the
presence of high levels of estrogen can induce maternal behavior in a virgin ewe. These effects are all
mediated by the hypothalamus, and the information is carried mainly by spinal pathways that relay in the
brainstem. Stimulation of the nipples stimulates release of oxytocin and prolactin and suppresses the release
of LH and FSH.
Cardiovascular stimuli are carried by the vagus nerve. The vagus also conveys a variety of visceral
information, including for instance signals arising from gastric distension or emptying, to suppress or
promote feeding, by signalling the release of leptin or gastrin, respectively. Again this information reaches
the hypothalamus via relays in the brainstem.
In addition hypothalamic function is responsive to—and regulated by—levels of all three classical
monoamine neurotransmitters, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), in those
tracts from which it receives innervation. For example, noradrenergic inputs arising from the locus
coeruleus have important regulatory effects upon corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels.
The extreme lateral part of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus is responsible for the control of
food intake. Stimulation of this area causes increased food intake. Bilateral lesion of this area causes
complete cessation of food intake. Medial parts of the nucleus have a controlling effect on the lateral part.
Bilateral lesion of the medial part of the ventromedial nucleus causes hyperphagia and obesity of the animal.
Further lesion of the lateral part of the ventromedial nucleus in the same animal produces complete cessation
of food intake.
There are different hypotheses related to this regulation:[35]
1. Lipostatic hypothesis: This hypothesis holds that adipose tissue produces a humoral signal
that is proportionate to the amount of fat and acts on the hypothalamus to decrease food
intake and increase energy output. It has been evident that a hormone leptin acts on the
hypothalamus to decrease food intake and increase energy output.
2. Gutpeptide hypothesis: gastrointestinal hormones like Grp, glucagons, CCK and others
claimed to inhibit food intake. The food entering the gastrointestinal tract triggers the release
of these hormones, which act on the brain to produce satiety. The brain contains both CCK-A
and CCK-B receptors.
3. Glucostatic hypothesis: The activity of the satiety center in the ventromedial nuclei is
probably governed by the glucose utilization in the neurons. It has been postulated that
when their glucose utilization is low and consequently when the arteriovenous blood

glucose difference across them is low, the activity
across the neurons decrease. Under these
conditions, the activity of the feeding center is
unchecked and the individual feels hungry. Food
intake is rapidly increased by intraventricular
administration of 2-deoxyglucose therefore
decreasing glucose utilization in cells.
4. Thermostatic hypothesis: According to this
hypothesis, a decrease in body temperature below
a given set-point stimulates appetite, whereas an
increase above the set-point inhibits appetite.
The medial zone of hypothalamus is part of a circuitry that
controls motivated behaviors, like defensive behaviors.[36]
Analyses of Fos-labeling showed that a series of nuclei in the
"behavioral control column" is important in regulating the
expression of innate and conditioned defensive behaviors.[37]
Antipredatory defensive behavior
Exposure to a predator (such as a cat) elicits defensive
behaviors in laboratory rodents, even when the animal has
never been exposed to a cat.[38] In the hypothalamus, this exposure causes an increase in Fos-labeled cells
in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus, the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial nucleus, and in the
ventrolateral part of the premammillary nucleus (PMDvl).[39] The premammillary nucleus has an important
role in expression of defensive behaviors towards a predator, since lesions in this nucleus abolish defensive
behaviors, like freezing and flight.[39][40] The PMD does not modulate defensive behavior in other
situations, as lesions of this nucleus had minimal effects on post-shock freezing scores.[40] The PMD has
important connections to the dorsal periaqueductal gray, an important structure in fear expression.[41][42] In
addition, animals display risk assessment behaviors to the environment previously associated with the cat.
Fos-labeled cell analysis showed that the PMDvl is the most activated structure in the hypothalamus, and
inactivation with muscimol prior to exposure to the context abolishes the defensive behavior.[39] Therefore,
the hypothalamus, mainly the PMDvl, has an important role in expression of innate and conditioned
defensive behaviors to a predator.
Social defeat
Likewise, the hypothalamus has a role in social defeat: Nuclei in medial zone are also mobilized during an
encounter with an aggressive conspecific. The defeated animal has an increase in Fos levels in sexually
dimorphic structures, such as the medial pre-optic nucleus, the ventrolateral part of ventromedial nucleus,
and the ventral premammilary nucleus.[5] Such structures are important in other social behaviors, such as
sexual and aggressive behaviors. Moreover, the premammillary nucleus also is mobilized, the dorsomedial
part but not the ventrolateral part.[5] Lesions in this nucleus abolish passive defensive behavior, like freezing
and the "on-the-back" posture.[5]
Fear processing
Learning arbitrator
Recent research has questioned whether the lateral hypothalamus's role is only restricted to initiating and
stopping innate behaviors and argued it learns about food-related cues. Specifically that it opposes learning
about information what is neutral or distant to food. According this view, the lateral hypothalamus is "a
unique arbitrator of learning capable of shifting behavior toward or away from important events".[43]

synthesized exclusively by neurons with their cell bodies in the tuberomammillary nucleus
(TMN) that lies within the posterior hypothalamus. There are approximately 64000
histaminergic neurons per side in humans. These cells project throughout the brain and
spinal cord. Areas that receive especially dense projections include the cerebral cortex,
hippocampus, neostriatum, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and hypothalamus.  ... While the
best characterized function of the histamine system in the brain is regulation of sleep and
arousal, histamine is also involved in learning and memory ... It also appears that histamine
is involved in the regulation of feeding and energy balance."
