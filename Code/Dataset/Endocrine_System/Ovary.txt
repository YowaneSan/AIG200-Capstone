Ovary
The ovary is a gonad in the female reproductive system that
produces ova.[1] When an ovum is released, this travels through
the fallopian tube/oviduct into the uterus. There is an ovary
(from Latin ōvārium 'egg, nut') found on the left and the right
side of the body. The ovaries also secrete hormones that play a
role in the menstrual cycle and fertility. The ovary progresses
through many stages beginning in the prenatal period through
menopause. It is also an endocrine gland because of the various
hormones that it secretes.[2]
Each ovary is whitish in color and located alongside the lateral
wall of the uterus in a region called the ovarian fossa. The
ovarian fossa is the region that is bounded by the external iliac
artery and in front of the ureter and the internal iliac artery. This
area is about 4 cm x 3 cm x 2 cm in size.[3][4]
The ovaries are surrounded by a capsule, and have an outer
cortex and an inner medulla.[4] The capsule is of dense
connective tissue and is known as the tunica albuginea.[5]
Usually, ovulation occurs in one of the two ovaries releasing an
egg each menstrual cycle.
The side of the ovary closest to the fallopian tube is connected
to it by infundibulopelvic ligament,[3] and the other side points
downwards attached to the uterus via the ovarian ligament.
Other structures and tissues of the ovaries include the hilum.
The ovaries lie within the peritoneal cavity, on either side of the
uterus, to which they are attached via a fibrous cord called the
ovarian ligament. The ovaries are uncovered in the peritoneal
cavity but are tethered to the body wall via the suspensory
ligament of the ovary, which is a posterior extension of the
broad ligament of the uterus. The part of the broad ligament of
the uterus that covers the ovary is known as the mesovarium.[4]

Anatomical terminology
Micrograph of the ovarian cortex
from a rhesus monkey showing
several round follicles embedded in a
matrix of stromal cells. A secondary
follicle sectioned through the nucleus
of an oocyte is at the upper left, and
earlier stage follicles are at the lower
right. The tissue was stained with the
dyes hematoxylin and eosin.
The ovarian pedicle is made up part of the fallopian tube,
mesovarium, ovarian ligament, and ovarian blood vessels.[6]
The surface of the ovaries is covered with a membrane
consisting of a lining of simple cuboidal-to-columnar shaped
mesothelium,[7] called the germinal epithelium.
The outer layer is the ovarian cortex, consisting of ovarian
follicles and stroma in between them. Included in the follicles are
the cumulus oophorus, membrana granulosa (and the granulosa
cells inside it), corona radiata, zona pellucida, and primary oocyte.
Theca of follicle, antrum and liquor folliculi are also contained in
the follicle. Also in the cortex is the corpus luteum derived from the
follicles. The innermost layer is the ovarian medulla.[8] It can be
hard to distinguish between the cortex and medulla, but follicles are
usually not found in the medulla.
Follicular cells are flat epithelial cells that originate from surface
epithelium covering the ovary. They are surrounded by granulosa
cells that have changed from flat to cuboidal and proliferated to
produce a stratified epithelium.
The ovary also contains blood vessels and lymphatics.[9]
At puberty, the ovary begins to secrete increasing levels of hormones. Secondary sex characteristics begin
to develop in response to the hormones. The ovary changes structure and function beginning at puberty.[2]
Since the ovaries are able to regulate hormones, they also play an important role in pregnancy and fertility.
When egg cells (oocytes) are released from the fallopian tube, a variety of feedback mechanisms stimulate
the endocrine system, which cause hormone levels to change.[10] These feedback mechanisms are
controlled by the hypothalamus and pituitary glands. Messages or signals from the hypothalamus are sent to
the pituitary gland. In turn, the pituitary gland releases hormones to the ovaries. From this signaling, the
ovaries release their own hormones.
The ovaries are the site of production and periodical release of egg cells, the female gametes. In the ovaries,
the developing egg cells (or oocytes) mature in the fluid-filled follicles. Typically, only one oocyte develops
at a time, but others can also mature simultaneously. Follicles are composed of different types and number
of cells according to the stage of their maturation, and their size is indicative of the stage of oocyte
development.[11]: 
833 
When an oocyte completes its maturation in the ovary, a surge of luteinizing hormone is secreted by the
pituitary gland, which stimulates the release of the oocyte through the rupture of the follicle, a process called
ovulation.[12] The follicle remains functional and reorganizes into a corpus luteum, which secretes

progesterone in order to prepare the uterus for an eventual
implantation of the embryo.[11]: 
839 
At maturity, ovaries secrete estrogen, androgen,[13][14] inhibin, and
progestogen.[15][16][2] In women before menopause, 50% of
testosterone is produced by the ovaries and released directly into the
blood stream. The other 50% of testosterone in the blood stream is
made from conversion of the adrenal pre-androgens ( DHEA and
androstenedione) to testosterone in other parts of the body. Estrogen
is responsible for the appearance of secondary sex characteristics
for females at puberty and for the maturation and maintenance of
the reproductive organs in their mature functional state. Progesterone prepares the uterus for pregnancy, and
the mammary glands for lactation. Progesterone functions with estrogen by promoting menstrual cycle
changes in the endometrium.
As women age, they experience a decline in reproductive performance leading to menopause. This decline
is tied to a decline in the number of ovarian follicles. Although about 1 million oocytes are present at birth in
the human ovary, only about 500 (about 0.05%) of these ovulate, and the rest are wasted. The decline in
ovarian reserve appears to occur at a constantly increasing rate with age,[17] and leads to nearly complete
exhaustion of the reserve by about age 52. As ovarian reserve and fertility decline with age, there is also a
parallel increase in pregnancy failure and meiotic errors resulting in chromosomally abnormal conceptions.
The ovarian reserve and fertility perform optimally around 20–30 years of age.[18] Around 45 years of age,
the menstrual cycle begins to change and the follicle pool decreases significantly.[18] The events that lead to
ovarian aging remain unclear. The variability of aging could include environmental factors, lifestyle habits
or genetic factors.[18]
Women with an inherited mutation in the DNA repair gene BRCA1 undergo menopause prematurely,[19]
suggesting that naturally occurring DNA damages in oocytes are repaired less efficiently in these women,
and this inefficiency leads to early reproductive failure. The BRCA1 protein plays a key role in a type of
DNA repair termed homologous recombinational repair that is the only known cellular process that can
accurately repair DNA double-strand breaks. Titus et al.[20] showed that DNA double-strand breaks
accumulate with age in humans and mice in primordial follicles. Primordial follicles contain oocytes that are
at an intermediate (prophase I) stage of meiosis. Meiosis is the general process in eukaryotic organisms by
which germ cells are formed, and it is likely an adaptation for removing DNA damages, especially double-
strand breaks, from germ line DNA (see Meiosis and Origin and function of meiosis).[21] Homologous
recombinational repair is especially promoted during meiosis. Titus et al.[20] also found that expression of 4
key genes necessary for homologous recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks (BRCA1,
MRE11, RAD51 and ATM) decline with age in the oocytes of humans and mice. They hypothesized that
DNA double-strand break repair is vital for the maintenance of oocyte reserve and that a decline in
efficiency of repair with age plays a key role in ovarian aging. A study identified 290 genetic determinants
of ovarian ageing, also found that DNA damage response processes are implicated and suggests that
possible effects of extending fertility in women would improve bone health, reduce risk of type 2 diabetes
and increase the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers.[22][23]
Hormone secretion
Ovarian aging
Polycystic ovaries typically found in polycystic
ovarian syndrome
A variety of testing methods can be used in order to determine fertility based on maternal age. Many of
these tests measure levels of hormones FSH, and GnrH. Methods such as measuring AMH (anti-Müllerian
hormone) levels, and AFC (antral follicule count) can predict ovarian aging. AMH levels serve as an
indicator of ovarian aging since the quality of ovarian follicles can be determined.[24]
Ovarian diseases can be classified as endocrine
disorders or as a disorders of the reproductive system.
If the egg fails to release from the follicle in the ovary
an ovarian cyst may form. Small ovarian cysts are
common in healthy women. Some women have more
follicles than usual (polycystic ovary syndrome),
which inhibits the follicles to grow normally and this
will cause cycle irregularities.

Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, often called ovarian
tissue cryopreservation, is of interest to women who want to
preserve their reproductive function beyond the natural limit,
or whose reproductive potential is threatened by cancer
therapy,[48] for example in hematologic malignancies or
breast cancer.[49] The procedure is to take a part of the ovary
and carry out slow freezing before storing it in liquid nitrogen
whilst therapy is undertaken. Tissue can then be thawed and
implanted near the fallopian, either orthotopic (on the natural location) or heterotopic (on the abdominal
wall),[49] where it starts to produce new eggs, allowing normal conception to take place.[50] A study of 60
procedures concluded that ovarian tissue harvesting appears to be safe.[49] The ovarian tissue may also be
transplanted into mice that are immunocompromised (SCID mice) to avoid graft rejection, and tissue can be
harvested later when mature follicles have developed.[51]
In former centuries, medical authors, for example Galen, referred to a woman's ovaries as "female testes".
Birds have only one functional ovary (the left), while the other
remains vestigial. In mammals including humans, the female ovary
is homologous to the male testicle, in that they are both gonads and
endocrine glands. Ovaries of some kind are found in the female
reproductive system of many invertebrates that employ sexual
reproduction. However, they develop in a very different way in
most invertebrates than they do in vertebrates, and are not truly
homologous.[52]
Many of the features found in human ovaries are common to all
vertebrates, including the presence of follicular cells, tunica
albuginea, and so on. However, many species produce a far greater
number of eggs during their lifetime than do humans, so that, in fish
and amphibians, there may be hundreds, or even millions of fertile
eggs present in the ovary at any given time. In these species, fresh
eggs may be developing from the germinal epithelium throughout
life. Corpora lutea are found only in mammals, and in some elasmobranch fish; in other species, the
remnants of the follicle are quickly resorbed by the ovary. In birds, reptiles, and monotremes, the egg is
relatively large, filling the follicle, and distorting the shape of the ovary at maturity.[52]

History
Other animals
Amphibians and reptiles have no ovarian medulla; the central part of the ovary is a hollow, lymph-filled
space.[53]
The ovary of teleosts is also often hollow, but in this case, the eggs are shed into the cavity, which opens
into the oviduct.[52] Certain nematodes of the genus Philometra are parasitic in the ovary of marine fishes
and can be spectacular, with females as long as 40  cm (16  in), coiled in the ovary of a fish half this
length.[54] Although most female vertebrates have two ovaries, this is not the case in all species. In most
birds and in platypuses, the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional. (Exceptions include
the kiwi and some, but not all raptors, in which both ovaries persist.[55][56]) In some elasmobranchs, only
the right ovary develops fully. In the primitive jawless fish, and some teleosts, there is only one ovary,
formed by the fusion of the paired organs in the embryo.[52]
