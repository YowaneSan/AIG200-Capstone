Pituitary gland
The pituitary gland or hypophysis is an endocrine gland in
vertebrates. In humans, the pituitary gland is located at the base of
the brain, protruding off the bottom of the hypothalamus. The
human pituitary gland is oval shaped, about the size of a
chickpea,[2] and weighs 0.5 grams (0.018 oz) on average.
Hormones secreted from the pituitary gland help to control growth,
blood pressure, energy management, all functions of the sex
organs, thyroid gland, metabolism, as well as some aspects of
pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, water/salt concentration at the
kidneys, temperature regulation, and pain relief.
In humans, the pituitary gland rests upon the hypophyseal fossa of
the sphenoid bone, in the center of the middle cranial fossa. It sits
in a protective bony enclosure called the sella turcica, covered by
the dural fold diaphragma sellae.[3]
The pituitary gland is composed of the anterior pituitary, the
posterior pituitary, and an intermediate lobe that joins them.[4] The
intermediate lobe is avascular and almost absent in humans. In
many animals, these three lobes are distinct. The intermediate lobe
is present in many animal species, particularly in rodents, mice, and
rats, which have been used extensively to study pituitary
development and function.[5] In all animals, the fleshy, glandular
anterior pituitary is distinct from the neural composition of the
posterior pituitary, which is an extension of the hypothalamus.[5]
The height of the pituitary gland ranges from 5.3 to 7.0 mm. The
volume of the pituitary gland ranges from 200 to 440 mm3.[6] Its
most common shape, found in 46% of people is flat, it is convex in
31.2% and concave in 22.8%.[6]
The anterior pituitary lobe (or adenohypophysis) arises from an
invagination of the oral ectoderm (Rathke's pouch). This contrasts
with the posterior pituitary, which originates from neuroectoderm.
Endocrine cells of the anterior pituitary are controlled by regulatory
hormones released by parvocellular neurosecretory cells in the
hypothalamic capillaries leading to infundibular blood vessels,

which in turn lead to a second capillary bed in the anterior pituitary.
This vascular relationship constitutes the hypophyseal portal
system. Diffusing out of the second capillary bed, the hypothalamic
releasing hormones then bind to anterior pituitary endocrine cells,
upregulating or downregulating their release of hormones.[7]
The anterior lobe of the pituitary can be divided into the pars
tuberalis (pars infundibularis) and pars distalis (pars glandularis)
that constitutes ~80% of the gland. The pars intermedia (the
intermediate lobe) lies between the pars distalis and the pars
tuberalis, and is rudimentary in the human, although in other
species it is more developed.[5] It develops from a depression in the
dorsal wall of the pharynx (stomal part) known as Rathke's pouch.
The anterior pituitary contains several different types of cells[8] that
synthesize and secrete hormones. Usually there is one type of cell
for each major hormone formed in anterior pituitary. With special
stains attached to high-affinity antibodies that bind with distinctive
hormone, at least 5 types of cells can be differentiated.

The posterior lobe develops as an extension of the hypothalamus, from the floor of the third ventricle. The
posterior pituitary hormones are synthesized by cell bodies in the hypothalamus. The magnocellular
neurosecretory cells, of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei located in the hypothalamus, project axons
down the infundibulum to terminals in the posterior pituitary. This simple arrangement differs sharply from
that of the adjacent anterior pituitary, which does not develop from the hypothalamus.
The release of pituitary hormones by both the anterior and posterior lobes is under the control of the
hypothalamus, albeit in different ways.[7]
Posterior
Function
Pituitary hormones
The anterior pituitary regulates several physiological
processes by secreting hormones. This includes stress (by
secreting ACTH), growth (by secreting GH), reproduction
(by secreting FSH and LH), metabolism rate (by secreting
TSH) and lactation (by secreting prolactin). The
intermediate lobe synthesizes and secretes melanocyte-
stimulating 
hormone. 
The 
posterior 
pituitary 
(or
neurohypophysis) is a lobe of the gland that is functionally
connected to the hypothalamus by the median eminence
via a small tube called the pituitary stalk (also called the
infundibular stalk or the infundibulum). It regulates
hydroelectrolytic stability (by secreting ADH), uterine
contraction during labor and human attachment (by
secreting oxytocin).
The anterior pituitary synthesizes and secretes hormones. All releasing hormones (-RH) referred to can
also be referred to as releasing factors (-RF).
Somatotropes:
Human growth hormone (HGH), also referred to as 'growth hormone' (GH) or somatotropin, is
released under the influence of hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH),
and is inhibited by hypothalamic somatostatin.
Corticotropes:
Cleaved from the precursor proopiomelanocortin protein, and include adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH), and beta-endorphin, and melanocyte-stimulating hormone are released.[9]
Thyrotropes:
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is released under the influence of hypothalamic
thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and is inhibited by somatostatin.
Gonadotropes:
Luteinizing hormone (LH).
Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), both released under influence of Gonadotropin-
releasing Hormone (GnRH)
Lactotropes:
Prolactin (PRL), whose release is inconsistently stimulated by hypothalamic TRH, oxytocin,
vasopressin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, angiotensin II, neuropeptide Y, galanin,
substance P, bombesin-like peptides (gastrin-releasing peptide, neuromedin B and C), and
neurotensin, and inhibited by hypothalamic dopamine.[10]
These hormones are released from the anterior pituitary under the influence of the hypothalamus.
Hypothalamic hormones are secreted to the anterior lobe by way of a special capillary system, called the
hypothalamic-hypophysial portal system.

There is also a non-endocrine cell population called folliculostellate cells.
The posterior pituitary stores and secretes (but does not synthesize) the following important endocrine
hormones:
Magnocellular neurons:
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also known as vasopressin and arginine vasopressin AVP), the
majority of which is released from the supraoptic nucleus in the hypothalamus.
Oxytocin, most of which is released from the paraventricular nucleus in the hypothalamus.
Oxytocin is one of the few hormones to create a positive feedback loop. For example, uterine
contractions stimulate the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary, which, in turn,
increases uterine contractions. This positive feedback loop continues throughout labour.
Hormones secreted from the pituitary gland help control the following body processes:
Growth (GH)
Blood pressure
Some aspects of pregnancy and childbirth including stimulation of uterine contractions
Breast milk production
Sex organ functions in both sexes
Thyroid gland function
Metabolic conversion of food into energy
Water and osmolarity regulation in the body
Water balance via the control of reabsorption of water by the kidneys
Temperature regulation
Pain relief
Some of the diseases involving the pituitary gland are:
Central diabetes insipidus caused by a deficiency of
vasopressin
Gigantism and acromegaly caused by an excess of
growth hormone in childhood and adult, respectively
Hypothyroidism caused by a deficiency of thyroid-
stimulating hormone
Hyperpituitarism, the increased (hyper) secretion of one
or more of the hormones normally produced by the
pituitary gland

All of the functions of the pituitary gland can be adversely affected by an over- or under-production of
associated hormones.
The pituitary gland is important for mediating the stress response, via the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
axis (HPA axis). Critically, pituitary gland growth during adolescence can be altered by early life stress such
as childhood maltreatment or maternal dysphoric behavior.[11]
It has been demonstrated that, after controlling for age, sex, and BMI, larger quantities of DHEA and
DHEA-S tended to be linked to larger pituitary volume.[12] Additionally, a correlation between pituitary
gland volume and Social Anxiety subscale scores was identified which provided a basis for exploring
mediation. Again controlling for age, sex, and BMI, DHEA and DHEA-S have been found to be predictive
of larger pituitary gland volume, which was also associated with increased ratings of social anxiety.[12] This
research provides evidence that pituitary gland volume mediates the link between higher DHEA(S) levels
(associated with relatively early adrenarche) and traits associated with social anxiety.[12] Children who
experience early adrenarcheal development tend to have larger pituitary gland volume compared to children
with later adrenarcheal development.[12]
The Greek physician Galen referred to the pituitary gland by only using the (Ancient Greek) name
ἀδήν,[13] gland.[14] He described the pituitary gland as part of a series of secretory organs for the excretion
of nasal mucus.[13] Anatomist Andreas Vesalius translated ἀδήν with glans, in quam pituita destillat, "gland
in which slime (pituita[15]) drips".[13][16] Besides this 'descriptive' name, Vesalius used glandula pituitaria,
from which the English name pituitary gland[17] is ultimately derived.
The expression glandula pituitaria is still used as official synonym beside hypophysis in the official Latin
nomenclature Terminologia Anatomica.[18] In the seventeenth century the supposed function of the
pituitary gland to produce nasal mucus was debunked.[13] The expression glandula pituitaria and its
English equivalent pituitary gland can only be justified from a historical point of view.[19] The inclusion of
this synonym is merely justified by noting that the main term hypophysis is a much less popular term.[20]
Note: hypophysial (or hypophyseal) means "related to the hypophysis (pituitary gland)".
The anatomist Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring coined the name hypophysis.[13] This name consists[13][19]
of ὑπό ('under')[14] and φύειν ('to grow').[14] In later Greek ὑπόφυσις is used differently by Greek
physicians as outgrowth.[13] Sömmering also used the equivalent expression appendix cerebri,[13][16] with

appendix as appendage.[15] In various languages, Hirnanhang[16] in German and hersenaanhangsel[21] in
Dutch, the terms are derived from appendix cerebri.
The pituitary gland is found in all vertebrates, but its structure varies among different groups.
The division of the pituitary described above is typical of mammals, and is also true, to varying degrees, of
all tetrapods. However, only in mammals does the posterior pituitary have a compact shape. In lungfish, it is
a relatively flat sheet of tissue lying above the anterior pituitary, but in amphibians, reptiles, and birds, it
becomes increasingly well developed. The intermediate lobe is, in general, not well developed in any
species and is entirely absent in birds.[22]
The structure of the pituitary in fish, apart from the lungfish, is generally different from that in other animals.
In general, the intermediate lobe tends to be well developed, and may equal the remainder of the anterior
pituitary in size. The posterior lobe typically forms a sheet of tissue at the base of the pituitary stalk, and in
most cases sends irregular finger-like projection into the tissue of the anterior pituitary, which lies directly
beneath it. The anterior pituitary is typically divided into two regions, a more anterior rostral portion and a
posterior proximal portion, but the boundary between the two is often not clearly marked. In elasmobranchs
there is an additional, ventral lobe beneath the anterior pituitary proper.[22]
The arrangement in lampreys, which are among the most primitive of all fish, may indicate how the
pituitary originally evolved in ancestral vertebrates. Here, the posterior pituitary is a simple flat sheet of
tissue at the base of the brain, and there is no pituitary stalk. Rathke's pouch remains open to the outside,
close to the nasal openings. Closely associated with the pouch are three distinct clusters of glandular tissue,
corresponding to the intermediate lobe, and the rostral and proximal portions of the anterior pituitary. These
various parts are separated by meningial membranes, suggesting that the pituitary of other vertebrates may
have formed from the fusion of a pair of separate, but associated, glands.[22]
Most armadillos also possess a neural secretory gland very similar in form to the posterior pituitary, but
located in the tail and associated with the spinal cord. This may have a function in osmoregulation.[22]
There is a structure analogous to the pituitary in the octopus brain.[23]
Although rudimentary in humans (and often considered part of the anterior pituitary), the intermediate lobe
located between the anterior and posterior pituitary is important to many animals. For instance, in fish, it is
believed to control physiological color change. In adult humans, it is just a thin layer of cells between the
anterior and posterior pituitary. The intermediate lobe produces melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH),
although this function is often (imprecisely) attributed to the anterior pituitary.
The intermediate lobe is, in general, not well developed in tetrapods, and is entirely absent in birds.[22]

gland in humans is described in Wikipedia as being the size of a pea. So common is this
description that it seemed likely to be wrong, as I confirmed by examining a selection of
peas. Wikipedia also gives the weight of the human pituitary as about half a gram, and in this
it is more correct. The pituitary in a human is at least five times the average size of my peas;
it is more like the size of a chickpea."
