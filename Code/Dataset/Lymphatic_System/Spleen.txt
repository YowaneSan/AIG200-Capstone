Anatomical terminology
Spleen
The spleen is an organ found in almost all vertebrates. Similar
in structure to a large lymph node, it acts primarily as a blood
filter. The word spleen comes from Ancient Greek σπλήν
(splḗn).[1]
The spleen plays very important roles in regard to red blood
cells (erythrocytes) and the immune system.[2] It removes old
red blood cells and holds a reserve of blood, which can be
valuable in case of hemorrhagic shock, and also recycles iron.
As a part of the mononuclear phagocyte system, it metabolizes
hemoglobin removed from senescent red blood cells. The
globin portion of hemoglobin is degraded to its constitutive
amino acids, and the heme portion is metabolized to bilirubin,
which is removed in the liver.[3][4]
The spleen houses antibody-producing lymphocytes in its white
pulp and monocytes which remove antibody-coated bacteria
and antibody-coated blood cells by way of blood and lymph
node circulation. These monocytes, upon moving to injured
tissue (such as the heart after myocardial infarction), turn into
dendritic cells and macrophages while promoting tissue
healing.[5][6][7] The spleen is a center of activity of the
mononuclear phagocyte system and is analogous to a large
lymph node, as its absence causes a predisposition to certain
infections.[8][4]
In humans, the spleen is purple in color and is in the left upper
quadrant of the abdomen.[3][9] The surgical process to remove
the spleen is known as a splenectomy.
The spleen is underneath the left part of the diaphragm, and has
a smooth, convex surface that faces the diaphragm. It is
underneath the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs. The other side of
the spleen is divided by a ridge into two regions: an anterior
gastric portion, and a posterior renal portion. The gastric surface
is directed forward, upward, and toward the middle, is broad
and concave, and is in contact with the posterior wall of the
stomach. Below this it is in contact with the tail of the pancreas.
The renal surface is directed medialward and downward. It is

somewhat flattened, considerably narrower than the gastric surface,
and is in relation with the upper part of the anterior surface of the
left kidney and occasionally with the left adrenal gland.
There are four ligaments attached to the spleen: gastrosplenic
ligament, splenorenal ligament, colicosplenic ligament, and
phrenocolic ligament.[10]
The spleen, in healthy adult humans, is approximately 7 to 14 centimetres (3 to 51⁄2 in) in length.
An easy way to remember the anatomy of the spleen is the 1×3×5×7×9×10×11 rule. The spleen is 1 by 3
by 5 inches (3 by 8 by 13 cm), weighs approximately 7 oz (200 g), and lies between the 9th and 11th ribs
on the left-hand side and along the axis of the 10th rib. The weight varies between 1 oz (28 g) and 8 oz
(230  g) (standard reference range),[12] correlating mainly to height, body weight and degree of acute
congestion but not to sex or age.[13]

Near the middle of the spleen is a long fissure, the hilum, which is the
point of attachment for the gastrosplenic ligament and the point of
insertion for the splenic artery and splenic vein. There are other
openings present for lymphatic vessels and nerves. In addition to the
splenic artery, collateral blood supply is provided by the adjacent short
gastric arteries.[14]
Like the thymus, the spleen possesses only efferent lymphatic vessels.
The spleen is part of the lymphatic system. Both the short gastric
arteries and the splenic artery supply it with blood.[15]
The germinal centers are supplied by arterioles called penicilliary
radicles.[16]
The spleen is innervated by the splenic plexus, which connects a branch of the celiac ganglia to the vagus
nerve.
The underlying central nervous processes coordinating the spleen's function seem to be embedded into the
Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis, and the brainstem, especially the subfornical organ.[17]

The spleen contains two different
tissues, white pulp (A) and red pulp
(B). The white pulp functions in
producing and growing immune and
blood cells. The red pulp functions in
filtering blood of antigens,
microorganisms, and defective or
worn-out red blood cells.
The spleen is unique in respect to its development within the gut. While most of the gut organs are
endodermally derived, the spleen is derived from mesenchymal tissue.[18] Specifically, the spleen forms
within, and from, the dorsal mesentery. However, it still shares the same blood supply—the celiac trunk—as
the foregut organs.

Other functions of the spleen are less prominent, especially in the
healthy adult:
Spleen produces all types of blood cells during fetal life
Production of opsonins, properdin, and tuftsin.
Release of neutrophils following myocardial
infarction.[19]
Creation of red blood cells. While the bone marrow is the
primary site of hematopoiesis in the adult, the spleen has
important hematopoietic functions up until the 5th month
of gestation. After birth, erythropoietic functions cease,
except in some hematologic disorders. As a major
lymphoid organ and a central player in the
reticuloendothelial system, the spleen retains the ability
to produce lymphocytes and, as such, remains a
hematopoietic organ.
Storage of red blood cells, lymphocytes and other formed elements. The spleen of horses
stores roughly 30 percent of the red blood cells and can release them when needed.[20] In
humans, up to a cup (240 ml) of red blood cells is held within the spleen and released in
cases of hypovolemia[21] and hypoxia.[22] It can store platelets in case of an emergency and

also clears old platelets from the circulation. Up to a quarter of lymphocytes are stored in the
spleen at any one time.
Enlargement of the spleen is known as splenomegaly. It may be
caused by sickle cell anemia, sarcoidosis, malaria, bacterial
endocarditis, leukemia, polycythemia vera, pernicious anemia,
Gaucher's disease, leishmaniasis, Hodgkin's disease, Banti's
disease, hereditary spherocytosis, cysts, glandular fever (including
mononucleosis or 'Mono' caused by the Epstein–Barr virus and
infection from cytomegalovirus), and tumours. Primary tumors of
the spleen include hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas. Marked
splenomegaly may result in the spleen occupying a large portion of
the left side of the abdomen.
The spleen is the largest collection of lymphoid tissue in the body. It is normally palpable in preterm infants,
in 30% of normal, full-term neonates, and in 5% to 10% of infants and toddlers. A spleen easily palpable
below the costal margin in any child over the age of 3–4 years should be considered abnormal until proven
otherwise.
Splenomegaly can result from antigenic stimulation (e.g., infection), obstruction of blood flow (e.g., portal
vein obstruction), underlying functional abnormality (e.g., hemolytic anemia), or infiltration (e.g., leukemia
or storage disease, such as Gaucher's disease). The most common cause of acute splenomegaly in children
is viral infection, which is transient and usually moderate. Basic work-up for acute splenomegaly includes a
complete blood count with differential, platelet count, and reticulocyte and atypical lymphocyte counts to
exclude hemolytic anemia and leukemia. Assessment of IgM antibodies to viral capsid antigen (a rising titer)
is indicated to confirm Epstein–Barr virus or cytomegalovirus. Other infections should be excluded if these
tests are negative.
Trauma, such as a road traffic collision, can cause rupture of the spleen, which is a situation requiring
immediate medical attention.
Asplenia refers to a non-functioning spleen, which may be congenital, or caused by traumatic injury,
surgical resection (splenectomy) or a disease such as sickle cell anaemia. Hyposplenia refers to a partially
functioning spleen. These conditions may cause[6] a modest increase in circulating white blood cells and
platelets, a diminished response to some vaccines, and an increased susceptibility to infection. In particular,
there is an increased risk of sepsis from polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria. Encapsulated bacteria inhibit
binding of complement or prevent complement assembled on the capsule from interacting with macrophage

receptors. Phagocytosis needs natural antibodies, which are immunoglobulins that facilitate phagocytosis
either directly or by complement deposition on the capsule. They are produced by IgM memory B cells (a
subtype of B cells) in the marginal zone of the spleen.[23][24]
A splenectomy (removal of the spleen) results in a greatly diminished frequency of memory B cells.[25] A
28-year follow-up of 740 World War II veterans whose spleens were removed on the battlefield showed a
significant increase in the usual death rate from pneumonia (6 rather than the expected 1.3) and an increase
in the death rate from ischemic heart disease (41 rather than the expected 30), but not from other
conditions.[26]
An accessory spleen is a small splenic nodule extra to the spleen usually formed in early embryogenesis.
Accessory spleens are found in approximately 10 percent of the population[27] and are typically around 1
centimeter in diameter. Splenosis is a condition where displaced pieces of splenic tissue (often following
trauma or splenectomy) autotransplant in the abdominal cavity as accessory spleens.[28]
Polysplenia is a congenital disease manifested by multiple small accessory spleens,[29] rather than a single,
full-sized, normal spleen. Polysplenia sometimes occurs alone, but it is often accompanied by other
developmental abnormalities such as intestinal malrotation or biliary atresia, or cardiac abnormalities, such
as dextrocardia. These accessory spleens are non-functional.
Splenic infarction is a condition in which blood flow supply to the spleen is compromised,[30] leading to
partial or complete infarction (tissue death due to oxygen shortage) in the organ.[31]
Splenic infarction occurs when the splenic artery or one of its branches are occluded, for example by a
blood clot. Although it can occur asymptomatically, the typical symptom is severe pain in the left upper
quadrant of the abdomen, sometimes radiating to the left shoulder. Fever and chills develop in some
cases.[32] It has to be differentiated from other causes of acute abdomen.
The spleen may be affected by hyaloserositis, in which it is coated with fibrous hyaline.[33][34]
There has been a long and varied history of misconceptions regarding the physiological role of the spleen,
and it has often been seen as a reservoir for juices closely linked to digestion.[35] In various cultures, the
organ has been linked to melancholia, due to the influence of ancient Greek medicine and the associated
doctrine of humourism, in which the spleen was believed to be a reservoir for an elusive fluid known as
"black bile" (one of the four humours).[35] The spleen also plays an important role in traditional Chinese
medicine, where it is considered to be a key organ that displays the Yin aspect of the Earth element (its Yang
counterpart is the stomach). In contrast, the Talmud (tractate Berachoth 61b) refers to the spleen as the
organ of laughter while possibly suggesting a link with the humoral view of the organ.

Etymologically, spleen comes from the Ancient Greek σπλήν (splḗn), where it was the idiomatic equivalent
of the heart in modern English. Persius, in his satires, associated spleen with immoderate laughter.[36]
In English, William Shakespeare frequently used the word spleen to signify melancholy, but also caprice
and merriment.[36] In Julius Caesar, he uses the spleen to describe Cassius's irritable nature:
Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humour? By the gods
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
When you are waspish.[37]
The spleen, as a byword for melancholy, has also been considered an actual disease.[38] In the early 18th
century, the physician Richard Blackmore considered it to be one of the two most prevalent diseases in
England (along with consumption).[38] In 1701, Anne Finch (later, Countess of Winchilsea) had published a
Pindaric ode, The Spleen, drawing on her first-hand experiences of an affliction which, at the time, also had
a reputation of being a fashionably upper-class disease of the English.[39] Both Blackmore and George
Cheyne treated this malady as the male equivalent of "the vapours", while preferring the more learned terms
"hypochondriasis" and "hysteria".[38][40][41] In the late 18th century, the German word Spleen came to
denote eccentric and hypochondriac tendencies that were thought to be characteristic of English people.[36]
In French, "splénétique" refers to a state of pensive sadness or melancholy. This usage was popularised by
the poems of Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867) and his collection Le Spleen de Paris, but it was also present
in earlier 19th-century Romantic literature.
The spleen is one of the many organs that may be included in offal. It is not widely eaten as a principal
ingredient, but cow spleen sandwiches are eaten in Sicilian cuisine.[42] Chicken spleen is one of the main
ingredients of Jerusalem mixed grill.[43]
In cartilaginous and ray-finned fish, the spleen consists primarily of
red pulp and is normally somewhat elongated, as it lies inside the
serosal lining of the intestine. In many amphibians, especially frogs,
it has the more rounded form and there is often a greater quantity of
white pulp.[44]
In reptiles, birds, and mammals, white pulp is always relatively
plentiful, and in birds and some mammals the spleen is typically
rounded, but it adjusts its shape somewhat to the arrangement of the
surrounding organs. In most vertebrates, the spleen continues to
produce red blood cells throughout life; only in mammals this
function is lost in middle-aged adults. Many mammals have tiny
spleen-like structures known as haemal nodes throughout the body

that are presumed to have the same function as the spleen.[44] The spleens of aquatic mammals differ in
some ways from those of fully land-dwelling mammals; in general they are bluish in colour. In cetaceans
and manatees they tend to be quite small, but in deep diving pinnipeds, they can be massive, due to their
function of storing red blood cells.
Marsupials have y-shaped spleens, and it develops postnatally.[45][46][47][48]
The only vertebrates lacking a spleen are the lampreys and hagfishes (the early-branching Cyclostomata, or
jawless fishes). Even in these animals, there is a diffuse layer of haematopoeitic tissue within the gut wall,
which has a similar structure to red pulp and is presumed homologous with the spleen of higher
vertebrates.[44]
In mice, the spleen stores half the body's monocytes so that, upon injury, they can migrate to the injured
tissue and transform into dendritic cells and macrophages to assist wound healing.[5]
