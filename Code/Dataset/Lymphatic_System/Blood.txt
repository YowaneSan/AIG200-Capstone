Anatomical terminology
Blood
Blood is a body fluid in the circulatory system of humans and
other vertebrates that delivers necessary substances such as
nutrients and oxygen to the cells, and transports metabolic
waste products away from those same cells.[1]
Blood is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma.
Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water
(92% by volume),[2] and contains proteins, glucose, mineral
ions, and hormones. The blood cells are mainly red blood cells
(erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and (in
mammals) platelets (thrombocytes).[3] The most abundant cells
are red blood cells.[4] These contain hemoglobin, which
facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to it,
increasing its solubility.[5] Jawed vertebrates have an adaptive
immune system, based largely on white blood cells. White
blood cells help to resist infections and parasites. Platelets are
important in the clotting of blood.
Blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by
the pumping action of the heart. In animals with lungs, arterial
blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body,
and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of
metabolism produced by cells, from the tissues to the lungs to
be exhaled. Blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is
oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated.[6][7]
Medical terms related to blood often begin with hemo-,
hemato-, haemo- or haemato- from the Greek word αἷμα
(haima) for "blood". In terms of anatomy and histology, blood
is considered a specialized form of connective tissue,[8] given
its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular
fibers in the form of fibrinogen.
Blood performs many important functions within the body,
including:
Supply of oxygen to tissues (bound to hemoglobin, which is carried in red cells)
Supply of nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids (dissolved in the blood or
bound to plasma proteins (e.g., blood lipids))
Removal of waste such as carbon dioxide, urea, and lactic acid
Functions
Hemoglobin, a globular protein
green = haem (or heme) groups
red & blue = protein subunits
Immunological functions, including circulation of white
blood cells, and detection of foreign material by
antibodies
Coagulation, the response to a broken blood vessel, the
conversion of blood from a liquid to a semisolid gel to
stop bleeding
Messenger functions, including the transport of
hormones and the signaling of tissue damage
Regulation of core body temperature
Hydraulic functions
Blood accounts for 7% of the human body weight,[9][10] with an
average density around 1060 kg/m3, very close to pure water's density of 1000 kg/m3.[11] The average
adult has a blood volume of roughly 5 litres (11 US pt) or 1.3 gallons,[10] which is composed of plasma and
formed elements. The formed elements are the two types of blood cell or corpuscle – the red blood cells,
(erythrocytes) and white blood cells (leukocytes), and the cell fragments called platelets[12] that are involved
in clotting. By volume, the red blood cells constitute about 45% of whole blood, the plasma about 54.3%,
and white cells about 0.7%.
Whole blood (plasma and cells) exhibits non-Newtonian fluid dynamics.

and organelles in mammals. The red blood cells
(together with endothelial vessel cells and other cells)
are also marked by glycoproteins that define the different
blood types. The proportion of blood occupied by red
blood cells is referred to as the hematocrit, and is
normally about 45%. The combined surface area of all
red blood cells of the human body would be roughly
2,000 times as great as the body's exterior surface.[14]
4,000–11,000 leukocytes:[15] White blood cells are part
of the body's immune system; they destroy and remove
old or aberrant cells and cellular debris, as well as attack
infectious agents (pathogens) and foreign substances.
The cancer of leukocytes is called leukemia.
200,000–500,000 thrombocytes:[15] Also called
platelets, they take part in blood clotting (coagulation). Fibrin from the coagulation cascade
creates a mesh over the platelet plug.
About 55% of blood is blood plasma, a
fluid that is the blood's liquid medium,
which by itself is straw-yellow in color.
The blood plasma volume totals of 2.7–3.0
liters (2.8–3.2 quarts) in an average human.
It is essentially an aqueous solution
containing 92% water, 8% blood plasma
proteins, and trace amounts of other
materials. 
Plasma 
circulates 
dissolved
nutrients, such as glucose, amino acids, and
fatty acids (dissolved in the blood or bound

Other important components include:
Serum albumin
Blood-clotting factors (to facilitate coagulation)
Immunoglobulins (antibodies)

Blood pH is regulated to stay within the narrow range of 7.35 to 7.45, making it slightly basic
(compensation).[17][18] Extra-cellular fluid in blood that has a pH below 7.35 is too acidic, whereas blood
pH above 7.45 is too basic.[16] A pH below 6.9 or above 7.8 is usually lethal.[16] Blood pH, partial pressure
of oxygen (pO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), and bicarbonate (HCO3
−) are carefully
regulated by a number of homeostatic mechanisms, which exert their influence principally through the
respiratory system and the urinary system to control the acid–base balance and respiration, which is called
compensation.[16] An arterial blood gas test measures these. Plasma also circulates hormones transmitting
their messages to various tissues. The list of normal reference ranges for various blood electrolytes is
extensive.
Human blood is typical of
that of mammals, although
the 
precise 
details
concerning cell numbers,
size, protein structure, and
so 
on, 
vary 
somewhat
between species. In non-
mammalian 
vertebrates,
however, there are some
key differences:[19]
Red blood cells of non-
mammalian vertebrates are flattened and ovoid in form,
and retain their cell nuclei.
There is considerable variation in the types and
proportions of white blood cells; for example, acidophils
are generally more common than in humans.
Platelets are unique to mammals; in other vertebrates,
small nucleated, spindle cells called thrombocytes are
responsible for blood clotting instead.
Blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the
pumping action of the heart. In humans, blood is pumped from the strong left ventricle of the heart through
arteries to peripheral tissues and returns to the right atrium of the heart through veins. It then enters the right
ventricle and is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and returns to the left atrium through the
pulmonary veins. Blood then enters the left ventricle to be circulated again. Arterial blood carries oxygen
from inhaled air to all of the cells of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of
metabolism by cells, to the lungs to be exhaled. However, one exception includes pulmonary arteries, which
contain the most deoxygenated blood in the body, while the pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood.

Basic hemoglobin saturation curve. It
is moved to the right in higher acidity
(more dissolved carbon dioxide) and
to the left in lower acidity (less

Additional return flow may be generated by the movement of
skeletal muscles, which can compress veins and push blood through
the valves in veins toward the right atrium.
The blood circulation was famously described by William Harvey
in 1628.[20]
In vertebrates, the various cells of blood are made in the bone
marrow in a process called hematopoiesis, which includes
erythropoiesis, the production of red blood cells; and myelopoiesis,
the production of white blood cells and platelets. During childhood,
almost every human bone produces red blood cells; as adults, red
blood cell production is limited to the larger bones: the bodies of the
vertebrae, the breastbone (sternum), the ribcage, the pelvic bones,
and the bones of the upper arms and legs. In addition, during
childhood, the thymus gland, found in the mediastinum, is an
important source of T lymphocytes.[21] The proteinaceous
component of blood (including clotting proteins) is produced
predominantly by the liver, while hormones are produced by the
endocrine glands and the watery fraction is regulated by the
hypothalamus and maintained by the kidney.
Healthy erythrocytes have a plasma life of about 120 days before
they are degraded by the spleen, and the Kupffer cells in the liver.
The liver also clears some proteins, lipids, and amino acids. The
kidney actively secretes waste products into the urine.
About 98.5%[22] of the
oxygen in a sample of
arterial blood in a healthy
human breathing air at sea-
level pressure is chemically
combined 
with 
the
hemoglobin. About 1.5% is
physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to
hemoglobin. The hemoglobin molecule is the primary transporter of
oxygen in mammals and many other species. Hemoglobin has an
oxygen binding capacity between 1.36 and 1.40 ml O2 per gram
hemoglobin,[23] which increases the total blood oxygen capacity
seventyfold,[24] compared to if oxygen solely were carried by its
solubility of 0.03 ml O2 per liter blood per mm Hg partial pressure
of oxygen (about 100 mm Hg in arteries).[24]
Cell production and degradation
Oxygen transport
With the exception of pulmonary and umbilical arteries and their corresponding veins, arteries carry
oxygenated blood away from the heart and deliver it to the body via arterioles and capillaries, where the
oxygen is consumed; afterwards, venules and veins carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart.
Under normal conditions in adult humans at rest, hemoglobin in blood leaving the lungs is about 98–99%
saturated with oxygen, achieving an oxygen delivery between 950 and 1150 ml/min[25] to the body. In a
healthy adult at rest, oxygen consumption is approximately 200–250 ml/min,[25] and deoxygenated blood
returning to the lungs is still roughly 75%[26][27] (70 to 78%)[25] saturated. Increased oxygen consumption
during sustained exercise reduces the oxygen saturation of venous blood, which can reach less than 15% in
a trained athlete; although breathing rate and blood flow increase to compensate, oxygen saturation in
arterial blood can drop to 95% or less under these conditions.[28] Oxygen saturation this low is considered
dangerous in an individual at rest (for instance, during surgery under anesthesia). Sustained hypoxia
(oxygenation less than 90%), is dangerous to health, and severe hypoxia (saturations less than 30%) may be
rapidly fatal.[29]
A fetus, receiving oxygen via the placenta, is exposed to much lower oxygen pressures (about 21% of the
level found in an adult's lungs), so fetuses produce another form of hemoglobin with a much higher affinity
for oxygen (hemoglobin F) to function under these conditions.[30]
CO2 is carried in blood in three different ways. (The exact percentages vary depending whether it is arterial
or venous blood). Most of it (about 70%) is converted to bicarbonate ions HCO−
3 by the enzyme carbonic
anhydrase in the red blood cells by the reaction CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 → H+ + HCO−
3; about 7% is
dissolved in the plasma; and about 23% is bound to hemoglobin as carbamino compounds.[31][32]
Hemoglobin, the main oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells, carries both oxygen and carbon
dioxide. However, the CO2 bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it
combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of allosteric effects on
the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of CO2 decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given
partial pressure of oxygen. The decreased binding to carbon dioxide in the blood due to increased oxygen
levels is known as the Haldane effect, and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to
the lungs. A rise in the partial pressure of CO2 or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from
hemoglobin, which is known as the Bohr effect.
Some oxyhemoglobin loses oxygen and becomes deoxyhemoglobin. Deoxyhemoglobin binds most of the
hydrogen ions as it has a much greater affinity for more hydrogen than does oxyhemoglobin.

Transport of hydrogen ions
Lymphatic system
Capillary blood from a bleeding finger
In mammals, blood is in equilibrium with lymph, which is continuously formed in tissues from blood by
capillary ultrafiltration. Lymph is collected by a system of small lymphatic vessels and directed to the
thoracic duct, which drains into the left subclavian vein, where lymph rejoins the systemic blood circulation.
Blood circulation transports heat throughout the body, and adjustments to this flow are an important part of
thermoregulation. Increasing blood flow to the surface (e.g., during warm weather or strenuous exercise)
causes warmer skin, resulting in faster heat loss. In contrast, when the external temperature is low, blood
flow to the extremities and surface of the skin is reduced and to prevent heat loss and is circulated to the
important organs of the body, preferentially.
Rate of blood flow varies greatly between different organs. Liver has the most abundant blood supply with
an approximate flow of 1350 ml/min. Kidney and brain are the second and the third most supplied organs,
with 1100 ml/min and ~700 ml/min, respectively.[33]
Relative rates of blood flow per 100 g of tissue are different, with kidney, adrenal gland and thyroid being
the first, second and third most supplied tissues, respectively.[33]
The restriction of blood flow can also be used in specialized tissues to cause engorgement, resulting in an
erection of that tissue; examples are the erectile tissue in the penis and clitoris.
Another example of a hydraulic function is the jumping spider, in which blood forced into the legs under
pressure causes them to straighten for a powerful jump, without the need for bulky muscular legs.[34]
Hemoglobin is the principal determinant of the color of blood
(hemochrome). Each molecule has four heme groups, and their
interaction with various molecules alters the exact color. Arterial
blood and capillary blood are bright red, as oxygen imparts a strong
red color to the heme group. Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade
of red; this is present in veins, and can be seen during blood
donation and when venous blood samples are taken. This is
because the spectrum of light absorbed by hemoglobin differs
between the oxygenated and deoxygenated states.[35]
Blood in carbon monoxide poisoning is bright red, because carbon
monoxide causes the formation of carboxyhemoglobin. In cyanide poisoning, the body cannot use oxygen,
so the venous blood remains oxygenated, increasing the redness. There are some conditions affecting the
heme groups present in hemoglobin that can make the skin appear blue – a symptom called cyanosis. If the
heme is oxidized, methemoglobin, which is more brownish and cannot transport oxygen, is formed. In the
rare condition sulfhemoglobinemia, arterial hemoglobin is partially oxygenated, and appears dark red with a
bluish hue.

Hydraulic functions
Color
Veins close to the surface of the skin appear blue for a variety of reasons. However, the factors that
contribute to this alteration of color perception are related to the light-scattering properties of the skin and
the processing of visual input by the visual cortex, rather than the actual color of the venous blood.[36]
Skinks in the genus Prasinohaema have green blood due to a buildup of the waste product biliverdin.[37]
Disorders of volume
Injury can cause blood loss through bleeding.[38] A healthy adult can lose almost 20% of
blood volume (1 L) before the first symptom, restlessness, begins, and 40% of volume
(2 L) before shock sets in. Thrombocytes are important for blood coagulation and the
formation of blood clots, which can stop bleeding. Trauma to the internal organs or bones
can cause internal bleeding, which can sometimes be severe.
Dehydration can reduce the blood volume by reducing the water content of the blood.
This would rarely result in shock (apart from the very severe cases) but may result in
orthostatic hypotension and fainting.
Disorders of circulation
Shock is the ineffective perfusion of tissues, and can be caused by a variety of conditions
including blood loss, infection, poor cardiac output.
Atherosclerosis reduces the flow of blood through arteries, because atheroma lines
arteries and narrows them. Atheroma tends to increase with age, and its progression can
be compounded by many causes including smoking, high blood pressure, excess
circulating lipids (hyperlipidemia), and diabetes mellitus.
Coagulation can form a thrombosis, which can obstruct vessels.
Problems with blood composition, the pumping action of the heart, or narrowing of blood
vessels can have many consequences including hypoxia (lack of oxygen) of the tissues
supplied. The term ischemia refers to tissue that is inadequately perfused with blood, and
infarction refers to tissue death (necrosis), which can occur when the blood supply has
been blocked (or is very inadequate).
Anemia
Insufficient red cell mass (anemia) can be the result of bleeding, blood disorders like
thalassemia, or nutritional deficiencies, and may require one or more blood transfusions.
Anemia can also be due to a genetic disorder in which the red blood cells do not function
effectively. Anemia can be confirmed by a blood test if the hemoglobin value is less than
13.5 gm/dl in men or less than 12.0 gm/dl in women.[39] Several countries have blood
banks to fill the demand for transfusable blood. A person receiving a blood transfusion
must have a blood type compatible with that of the donor.

Non-cancerous overproduction of red cells (polycythemia vera) or platelets (essential

Myelodysplastic syndromes involve ineffective production of one or more cell lines.
Disorders of coagulation
Hemophilia is a genetic illness that causes dysfunction in one of the blood's clotting
mechanisms. This can allow otherwise inconsequential wounds to be life-threatening,
but more commonly results in hemarthrosis, or bleeding into joint spaces, which can be
crippling.
Ineffective or insufficient platelets can also result in coagulopathy (bleeding disorders).
Hypercoagulable state (thrombophilia) results from defects in regulation of platelet or
clotting factor function, and can cause thrombosis.
Infectious disorders of blood
Blood is an important vector of infection. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is transmitted
through contact with blood, semen or other body secretions of an infected person.
Hepatitis B and C are transmitted primarily through blood contact. Owing to blood-borne
infections, bloodstained objects are treated as a biohazard.
Bacterial infection of the blood is bacteremia or sepsis. Viral Infection is viremia. Malaria
and trypanosomiasis are blood-borne parasitic infections.
Substances other than oxygen can bind to hemoglobin; in some cases, this can cause irreversible damage to
the body. Carbon monoxide, for example, is extremely dangerous when carried to the blood via the lungs
by inhalation, because carbon monoxide irreversibly binds to hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin, so
that less hemoglobin is free to bind oxygen, and fewer oxygen molecules can be transported throughout the
blood. This can cause suffocation insidiously. A fire burning in an enclosed room with poor ventilation
presents a very dangerous hazard, since it can create a build-up of carbon monoxide in the air. Some carbon
monoxide binds to hemoglobin when smoking tobacco.[40]
Blood for transfusion is obtained from human donors by blood
donation and stored in a blood bank. There are many different
blood types in humans, the ABO blood group system, and the
Rhesus blood group system being the most important. Transfusion
of blood of an incompatible blood group may cause severe, often
fatal, complications, so crossmatching is done to ensure that a
compatible blood product is transfused.
Other blood products administered intravenously are platelets,
blood plasma, cryoprecipitate, and specific coagulation factor
concentrates.

Intravenous administration
Jan Janský is credited with
the first classification of
blood into four types (A, B,
AB, and O)
Many forms of medication (from antibiotics to chemotherapy) are administered intravenously, as they are
not readily or adequately absorbed by the digestive tract.
After severe acute blood loss, liquid preparations, generically known as plasma expanders, can be given
intravenously, either solutions of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2 etc.) at physiological concentrations, or colloidal
solutions, such as dextrans, human serum albumin, or fresh frozen plasma. In these emergency situations, a
plasma expander is a more effective life-saving procedure than a blood transfusion, because the metabolism
of transfused red blood cells does not restart immediately after a transfusion.
In modern evidence-based medicine, bloodletting is used in management of a few rare diseases, including
hemochromatosis and polycythemia. However, bloodletting and leeching were common unvalidated
interventions used until the 19th century, as many diseases were incorrectly thought to be due to an excess
of blood, according to Hippocratic medicine.
English blood (Old English blod) derives from Germanic and has cognates
with a similar range of meanings in all other Germanic languages (e.g.
German Blut, Swedish blod, Gothic blōþ). There is no accepted Indo-
European etymology.[41]
Robin Fåhræus (a Swedish physician who devised the erythrocyte
sedimentation rate) suggested that the Ancient Greek system of humorism,
wherein the body was thought to contain four distinct bodily fluids
(associated with different temperaments), were based upon the observation
of blood clotting in a transparent container. When blood is drawn in a glass
container and left undisturbed for about an hour, four different layers can be
seen. A dark clot forms at the bottom (the "black bile"). Above the clot is a
layer of red blood cells (the "blood"). Above this is a whitish layer of white
blood cells (the "phlegm"). The top layer is clear yellow serum (the "yellow bile").[42]
The ABO blood group system was discovered in the year 1900 by Karl Landsteiner. Jan Janský is credited
with the first classification of blood into the four types (A, B, AB, and O) in 1907, which remains in use
today. In 1907 the first blood transfusion was performed that used the ABO system to predict
compatibility.[43] The first non-direct transfusion was performed on 27 March 1914. The Rhesus factor was
discovered in 1937.

Culture and religion
Due to its importance to life, blood is associated with a large number of beliefs. One of the most basic is the
use of blood as a symbol for family relationships through birth/parentage; to be "related by blood" is to be
related by ancestry or descendence, rather than marriage. This bears closely to bloodlines, and sayings such
as "blood is thicker than water" and "bad blood", as well as "Blood brother".
Blood is given particular emphasis in the Islamic, Jewish, and Christian religions, because Leviticus 17:11
says "the life of a creature is in the blood." This phrase is part of the Levitical law forbidding the drinking of
blood or eating meat with the blood still intact instead of being poured off.
Mythic references to blood can sometimes be connected to the life-giving nature of blood, seen in such
events as childbirth, as contrasted with the blood of injury or death.
In many indigenous Australian Aboriginal peoples' traditions, ochre (particularly red) and blood, both high
in iron content and considered Maban, are applied to the bodies of dancers for ritual. As Lawlor states:
In many Aboriginal rituals and ceremonies, red ochre is rubbed all over the naked bodies of the
dancers. In secret, sacred male ceremonies, blood extracted from the veins of the participant's
arms is exchanged and rubbed on their bodies. Red ochre is used in similar ways in less-secret
ceremonies. Blood is also used to fasten the feathers of birds onto people's bodies. Bird feathers
contain a protein that is highly magnetically sensitive.[44]
Lawlor comments that blood employed in this fashion is held by these peoples to attune the dancers to the
invisible energetic realm of the Dreamtime. Lawlor then connects these invisible energetic realms and
magnetic fields, because iron is magnetic.
Among the Germanic tribes, blood was used during their sacrifices; the Blóts. The blood was considered to
have the power of its originator, and, after the butchering, the blood was sprinkled on the walls, on the
statues of the gods, and on the participants themselves. This act of sprinkling blood was called blóedsian in
Old English, and the terminology was borrowed by the Roman Catholic Church becoming to bless and
blessing. The Hittite word for blood, ishar was a cognate to words for "oath" and "bond", see Ishara. The
Ancient Greeks believed that the blood of the gods, ichor, was a substance that was poisonous to mortals.
As a relic of Germanic Law, the cruentation, an ordeal where the corpse of the victim was supposed to start
bleeding in the presence of the murderer, was used until the early 17th century.[45]
In Genesis 9:4, God prohibited Noah and his sons from eating blood (see Noahide Law). This command
continued to be observed by the Eastern Orthodox Church.
It is also found in the Bible that when the Angel of Death came around to the Hebrew house that the first-
born child would not die if the angel saw lamb's blood wiped across the doorway.
Indigenous Australians
European paganism
Christianity
At the Council of Jerusalem, the apostles prohibited certain Christians from consuming blood  – this is
documented in Acts 15:20 and 29. This chapter specifies a reason (especially in verses 19–21): It was to
avoid offending Jews who had become Christians, because the Mosaic Law Code prohibited the practice.
Christ's blood is the means for the atonement of sins. Also, "... the blood of Jesus Christ his [God] Son
cleanseth us from all sin." (1 John 1:7), "... Unto him [God] that loved us, and washed us from our sins in
his own blood." (Revelation 1:5), and "And they overcame him (Satan) by the blood of the Lamb [Jesus the
Christ], and by the word of their testimony ..." (Revelation 12:11).
Some Christian churches, including Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, and the
Assyrian Church of the East teach that, when consecrated, the Eucharistic wine actually becomes the blood
of Jesus for worshippers to drink. Thus in the consecrated wine, Jesus becomes spiritually and physically
present. This teaching is rooted in the Last Supper, as written in the four gospels of the Bible, in which
Jesus stated to his disciples that the bread that they ate was his body, and the wine was his blood. "This cup
is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you." (Luke 22:20).
Most forms of Protestantism, especially those of a Methodist or Presbyterian lineage, teach that the wine is
no more than a symbol of the blood of Christ, who is spiritually but not physically present. Lutheran
theology teaches that the body and blood is present together "in, with, and under" the bread and wine of the
Eucharistic feast.
In Judaism, animal blood may not be consumed even in the smallest quantity (Leviticus 3:17 and
elsewhere); this is reflected in Jewish dietary laws (Kashrut). Blood is purged from meat by rinsing and
soaking in water (to loosen clots), salting and then rinsing with water again several times.[46] Eggs must
also be checked and any blood spots removed before consumption.[47] Although blood from fish is
biblically kosher, it is rabbinically forbidden to consume fish blood to avoid the appearance of breaking the
Biblical prohibition.[48]
Another ritual involving blood involves the covering of the blood of fowl and game after slaughtering
(Leviticus 17:13); the reason given by the Torah is: "Because the life of the animal is [in] its blood" (ibid
17:14). In relation to human beings, Kabbalah expounds on this verse that the animal soul of a person is in
the blood, and that physical desires stem from it.
Likewise, the mystical reason for salting temple sacrifices and slaughtered meat is to remove the blood of
animal-like passions from the person. By removing the animal's blood, the animal energies and life-force
contained in the blood are removed, making the meat fit for human consumption.[49]
Consumption of food containing blood is forbidden by Islamic dietary laws. This is derived from the
statement in the Qur'an, sura Al-Ma'ida (5:3): "Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh
of swine, and that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah."
Blood is considered unclean, hence there are specific methods to obtain physical and ritual status of
cleanliness once bleeding has occurred. Specific rules and prohibitions apply to menstruation, postnatal
bleeding and irregular vaginal bleeding. When an animal has been slaughtered, the animal's neck is cut in a

way to ensure that the spine is not severed, hence the brain may send commands to the heart to pump blood
to it for oxygen. In this way, blood is removed from the body, and the meat is generally now safe to cook
and eat. In modern times, blood transfusions are generally not considered against the rules.
Based on their interpretation of scriptures such as Acts 15:28, 29 ("Keep abstaining...from blood."), many
Jehovah's Witnesses neither consume blood nor accept transfusions of whole blood or its major
components: red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets (thrombocytes), and plasma. Members may
personally decide whether they will accept medical procedures that involve their own blood or substances
that are further fractionated from the four major components.[50]
Vampires are mythical creatures that drink blood directly for sustenance, usually with a preference for
human blood. Cultures all over the world have myths of this kind; for example the 'Nosferatu' legend, a
human who achieves damnation and immortality by drinking the blood of others, originates from Eastern
European folklore. Ticks, leeches, female mosquitoes, vampire bats, and an assortment of other natural
creatures do consume the blood of other animals, but only bats are associated with vampires. This has no
relation to vampire bats, which are New World creatures discovered well after the origins of the European
myths.
In invertebrates, a body fluid analogous to blood called hemolymph is found, the main difference being that
hemolymph is not contained in a closed circulatory system. Hemolymph may function to carry oxygen,
although hemoglobin is not necessarily used. Crustaceans and mollusks use hemocyanin instead of
hemoglobin.[51] In most insects, their hemolymph does not contain oxygen-carrying molecules because
their bodies are small enough for their tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen.
Blood residue can help forensic investigators identify weapons, reconstruct a criminal action, and link
suspects to the crime. Through bloodstain pattern analysis, forensic information can also be gained from the
spatial distribution of bloodstains.
Blood residue analysis is also a technique used in archeology.

Blood is one of the body fluids that has been used in art.[52] In particular, the performances of Viennese
Actionist Hermann Nitsch, Istvan Kantor, Franko B, Lennie Lee, Ron Athey, Yang Zhichao, Lucas Abela
and Kira O'Reilly, along with the photography of Andres Serrano, have incorporated blood as a prominent
visual element. Marc Quinn has made sculptures using frozen blood, including a cast of his own head made
using his own blood.
The term blood is used in genealogical circles to refer to one's ancestry, origins, and ethnic background as in
the word bloodline. Other terms where blood is used in a family history sense are blue-blood, royal blood,
mixed-blood and blood relative.
