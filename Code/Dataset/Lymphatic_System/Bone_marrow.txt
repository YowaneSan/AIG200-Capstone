Anatomical terminology
Bone marrow
Bone marrow is a semi-solid tissue found within the spongy
(also known as cancellous) portions of bones.[2] In birds and
mammals, bone marrow is the primary site of new blood cell
production 
(or 
haematopoiesis).[3] 
It 
is 
composed 
of
hematopoietic cells, marrow adipose tissue, and supportive
stromal cells. In adult humans, bone marrow is primarily
located in the ribs, vertebrae, sternum, and bones of the
pelvis.[4] Bone marrow comprises approximately 5% of total
body mass in healthy adult humans, such that a man weighing
73  kg (161  lbs) will have around 3.7  kg (8  lbs) of bone
marrow.[5]
Human marrow produces approximately 500 billion blood cells
per day, which join the systemic circulation via permeable
vasculature sinusoids within the medullary cavity.[6] All types
of hematopoietic cells, including both myeloid and lymphoid
lineages, are created in bone marrow; however, lymphoid cells
must migrate to other lymphoid organs (e.g. thymus) in order to
complete maturation.
Bone marrow transplants can be conducted to treat severe
diseases of the bone marrow, including certain forms of cancer
such as leukemia. Several types of stem cells are related to bone
marrow. Hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow can give
rise to hematopoietic lineage cells, and mesenchymal stem cells,
which can be isolated from the primary culture of bone marrow
stroma, can give rise to bone, adipose, and cartilage tissue.[7]
The composition of marrow is dynamic, as the mixture of
cellular and non-cellular components (connective tissue) shifts
with age and in response to systemic factors. In humans,
marrow is colloquially characterized as "red" or "yellow"
marrow (Latin: medulla ossium rubra, Latin: medulla ossium
flava, 
respectively) 
depending 
on 
the 
prevalence 
of
hematopoietic cells vs fat cells. While the precise mechanisms
underlying marrow regulation are not understood,[6] compositional changes occur according to stereotypical
patterns.[8] For example, a newborn baby's bones exclusively contain hematopoietically active "red"
marrow, and there is a progressive conversion towards "yellow" marrow with age. In adults, red marrow is
found mainly in the central skeleton, such as the pelvis, sternum, cranium, ribs, vertebrae and scapulae, and

Hematopoietic precursor cells:

cells from a bone marrow aspirate
variably found in the proximal epiphyseal ends of long bones such as the femur and humerus. In
circumstances of chronic hypoxia, the body can convert yellow marrow back to red marrow to increase
blood cell production.[9]
At the cellular level, the main functional component of bone
marrow includes the progenitor cells which are destined to mature
into blood and lymphoid cells. Human marrow produces
approximately 500 billion blood cells per day.[10] Marrow contains
hematopoietic stem cells which give rise to the three classes of
blood cells that are found in circulation: white blood cells
(leukocytes), red blood cells (erythrocytes), and platelets
(thrombocytes).[11]

The stroma of the bone marrow includes all tissue not directly involved in the marrow's primary function of
hematopoiesis.[6] Stromal cells may be indirectly involved in hematopoiesis, providing a microenvironment
that influences the function and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. For instance, they generate colony
stimulating factors, which have a significant effect on hematopoiesis. Cell types that constitute the bone
marrow stroma include:
fibroblasts (reticular connective tissue)
macrophages, which contribute especially to red blood cell production, as they deliver iron
for hemoglobin production.
adipocytes (fat cells)
osteoblasts (synthesize bone)
osteoclasts (resorb bone)
Stroma
endothelial cells, which form the sinusoids. These derive from endothelial stem cells, which
are also present in the bone marrow.[11]
That bone marrow is a priming site for T-cell responses to blood-borne antigens was first described in
2003.[13] Mature circulating naïve T cells home to bone marrow sinuses after they have passed through
arteries and arterioles.[14] They transmigrate sinus endothelium and enter the parenchyma which contains
dendritic cells (DCs). These have a capacity of antigen uptake, processing, and presentation.[13] Cognate
interactions between antigen-specific T cells and antigen-presenting DCs (APCs) in parenchyma lead to
rapid T-APC cluster formation followed by T cell activation, T cell proliferation and T cell re-circulation to
blood.[13] These findings were corroborated and extended in 2013 by in situ two-photon dynamic imaging
of mice skulls.[15]
Bone marrow is a nest for migratory memory T cells[16] and a sanctuary for plasma cells.[17] This has
implications for adaptive immunity and vaccinology.[17] Memory B and T cells persist in the parenchyma in
dedicated survival niches organized by stromal cells.[18] This memory can be maintained over long time
periods in the form of quiescent cells[18] or by repeated antigenic restimulation.[19] Bone marrow protects
and optimizes immunological memory during dietary restriction.[20] In cancer patients, cancer-reactive
memory T cells can arise in bone marrow spontaneously or after specific vaccination.[21] Bone marrow is a
center of a variety of immune activities: i) hematopoiesis, ii) osteogenesis, iii) immune responses, iv)
distinction between self and non-self antigens, v) central immune regulatory function, vi) storage of memory
cells, vii) immune surveillance of the central nervous system, viii) adaptation to energy crisis, ix) provision
of mesenchymal stem cells for tissue repair. [22]
The bone marrow stroma contains mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),[11] which are also known as marrow
stromal cells. These are multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types. MSCs have
been shown to differentiate, in vitro or in vivo, into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes, marrow
adipocytes and beta-pancreatic islets cells.
The blood vessels of the bone marrow constitute a barrier, inhibiting immature blood cells from leaving the
marrow. Only mature blood cells contain the membrane proteins, such as aquaporin and glycophorin, that
are required to attach to and pass the blood vessel endothelium.[23] Hematopoietic stem cells may also cross
the bone marrow barrier, and may thus be harvested from blood.

Lymphatic role
The red bone marrow is a key element of the lymphatic system, being one of the primary lymphoid organs
that generate lymphocytes from immature hematopoietic progenitor cells.[24] The bone marrow and thymus
constitute the primary lymphoid tissues involved in the production and early selection of lymphocytes.
Furthermore, bone marrow performs a valve-like function to prevent the backflow of lymphatic fluid in the
lymphatic system.
Biological compartmentalization is evident within the bone marrow, in that certain cell types tend to
aggregate in specific areas. For instance, erythrocytes, macrophages, and their precursors tend to gather
around blood vessels, while granulocytes gather at the borders of the bone marrow.[11]
People have used animal bone-marrow in cuisine worldwide for millennia, as in the famed Milanese
Ossobuco.[25]
The normal bone marrow architecture can be damaged or displaced by aplastic anemia, malignancies such
as multiple myeloma, or infections such as tuberculosis, leading to a decrease in the production of blood
cells and blood platelets. The bone marrow can also be affected by various forms of leukemia, which
attacks its hematologic progenitor cells.[26] Furthermore, exposure to radiation or chemotherapy will kill
many of the rapidly dividing cells of the bone marrow, and will therefore result in a depressed immune
system. Many of the symptoms of radiation poisoning are due to damage sustained by the bone marrow
cells.
To diagnose diseases involving the bone marrow, a bone marrow aspiration is sometimes performed. This
typically involves using a hollow needle to acquire a sample of red bone marrow from the crest of the ilium
under general or local anesthesia.[27]
Bone marrow derived stem cells have a wide array of application in regenerative medicine.[28]
Medical imaging may provide a limited amount of information regarding bone marrow. Plain film x-rays
pass through soft tissues such as marrow and do not provide visualization, although any changes in the
structure of the associated bone may be detected.[29] CT imaging has somewhat better capacity for
assessing the marrow cavity of bones, although with low sensitivity and specificity. For example, normal
fatty "yellow" marrow in adult long bones is of low density (-30 to -100 Hounsfield units), between
subcutaneous fat and soft tissue. Tissue with increased cellular composition, such as normal "red" marrow
or cancer cells within the medullary cavity will measure variably higher in density.[30]

Imaging

MRI is more sensitive and specific for assessing bone composition. MRI enables assessment of the average
molecular composition of soft tissues and thus provides information regarding the relative fat content of
marrow. In adult humans, "yellow" fatty marrow is the dominant tissue in bones, particularly in the
(peripheral) appendicular skeleton. Because fat molecules have a high T1-relaxivity, T1-weighted imaging
sequences show "yellow" fatty marrow as bright (hyperintense). Furthermore, normal fatty marrow loses
signal on fat-saturation sequences, in a similar pattern to subcutaneous fat.
When "yellow" fatty marrow becomes replaced by tissue with more cellular composition, this change is
apparent as decreased brightness on T1-weighted sequences. Both normal "red" marrow and pathologic
marrow lesions (such as cancer) are darker than "yellow" marrow on T1-weight sequences, although can
often be distinguished by comparison with the MR signal intensity of adjacent soft tissues. Normal "red"
marrow is typically equivalent or brighter than skeletal muscle or intervertebral disc on T1-weighted
sequences.[8][31]
Fatty marrow change, the inverse of red marrow hyperplasia, can occur with normal aging,[32] though it
can also be seen with certain treatments such as radiation therapy. Diffuse marrow T1 hypointensity without
contrast enhancement or cortical discontinuity suggests red marrow conversion or myelofibrosis. Falsely
normal marrow on T1 can be seen with diffuse multiple myeloma or leukemic infiltration when the water to
fat ratio is not sufficiently altered, as may be seen with lower grade tumors or earlier in the disease
process.[33]
Bone marrow examination is the pathologic analysis of samples of bone
marrow obtained via biopsy and bone marrow aspiration. Bone marrow
examination is used in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, including
leukemia, multiple myeloma, anemia, and pancytopenia. The bone marrow
produces the cellular elements of the blood, including platelets, red blood cells
and white blood cells. While much information can be gleaned by testing the
blood itself (drawn from a vein by phlebotomy), it is sometimes necessary to
examine the source of the blood cells in the bone marrow to obtain more
information on hematopoiesis; this is the role of bone marrow aspiration and
biopsy.
The ratio between myeloid series and erythroid cells is relevant to bone
marrow function, and also to diseases of the bone marrow and peripheral
blood, such as leukemia and anemia. The normal myeloid-to-erythroid ratio is
around 3:1; this ratio may increase in myelogenous leukemias, decrease in polycythemias, and reverse in
cases of thalassemia.[34]
In a bone marrow transplant, hematopoietic stem cells are removed from a person and infused into another
person (allogenic) or into the same person at a later time (autologous). If the donor and recipient are
compatible, these infused cells will then travel to the bone marrow and initiate blood cell production.
Transplantation from one person to another is conducted for the treatment of severe bone marrow diseases,
such as congenital defects, autoimmune diseases or malignancies. The patient's own marrow is first killed

off with drugs or radiation, and then the new stem cells are
introduced. Before radiation therapy or chemotherapy in cases of
cancer, some of the patient's hematopoietic stem cells are sometimes
harvested and later infused back when the therapy is finished to
restore the immune system.[35]
Bone marrow stem cells can be induced to become neural cells to
treat neurological illnesses,[36] and can also potentially be used for
the treatment of other illnesses, such as inflammatory bowel
disease.[37] In 2013, following a clinical trial, scientists proposed
that bone marrow transplantation could be used to treat HIV in
conjunction with antiretroviral drugs;[38][39] however, it was later
found that HIV remained in the bodies of the test subjects.[40]
The stem cells are typically harvested directly from the red marrow
in the iliac crest, often under general anesthesia. The procedure is
minimally invasive and does not require stitches afterwards.
Depending on the donor's health and reaction to the procedure, the actual harvesting can be an outpatient
procedure, or can require 1–2 days of recovery in the hospital.[41]
Another option is to administer certain drugs that stimulate the release of stem cells from the bone marrow
into circulating blood.[42] An intravenous catheter is inserted into the donor's arm, and the stem cells are
then filtered out of the blood. This procedure is similar to that used in blood or platelet donation. In adults,
bone marrow may also be taken from the sternum, while the tibia is often used when taking samples from
infants.[27] In newborns, stem cells may be retrieved from the umbilical cord.[43]
Using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) and Next-generation Sequencing (NGS) a
maximum of five DNA viruses per individual have been identified. Included were several herpesviruses,
hepatitis B virus, Merkel cell polyomavirus, and human papillomavirus 31. Given the reactivation and/or
oncogenic potential of these viruses, their repercussion on hematopoietic and malignant disorders calls for
further studies.[44]
The earliest fossilised evidence of bone marrow was
discovered in 2014 in Eusthenopteron, a lobe-finned fish
which lived during the Devonian period approximately 370
million years ago.[45] Scientists from Uppsala University and
the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility used X-ray
synchrotron microtomography to study the fossilised interior
of the skeleton's humerus, finding organised tubular
structures akin to modern vertebrate bone marrow.[45]
