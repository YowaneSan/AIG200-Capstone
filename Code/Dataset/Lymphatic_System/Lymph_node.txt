Lymph node
A lymph node, or lymph gland,[1] is a kidney-shaped organ of
the lymphatic system and the adaptive immune system. A large
number of lymph nodes are linked throughout the body by the
lymphatic vessels. They are major sites of lymphocytes that
include B and T cells. Lymph nodes are important for the
proper functioning of the immune system, acting as filters for
foreign particles including cancer cells, but have no
detoxification function.
In the lymphatic system, a lymph node is a secondary lymphoid
organ. A lymph node is enclosed in a fibrous capsule and is
made up of an outer cortex and an inner medulla.
Lymph nodes become inflamed or enlarged in various diseases,
which may range from trivial throat infections to life-
threatening cancers. The condition of lymph nodes is very
important in cancer staging, which decides the treatment to be
used and determines the prognosis. Lymphadenopathy refers to
glands that are enlarged or swollen. When inflamed or
enlarged, lymph nodes can be firm or tender.
Lymph nodes are kidney or oval shaped and range in size from
2  mm to 25  mm on their long axis, with an average of
15 mm.[2]
Each lymph node is surrounded by a fibrous capsule, which
extends inside a lymph node to form trabeculae.[3] The
substance of a lymph node is divided into the outer cortex and
the inner medulla.[3] These are rich with cells.[4] The hilum is
an indent on the concave surface of the lymph node where
lymphatic vessels leave and blood vessels enter and leave.[4]
Lymph enters the convex side of a lymph node through
multiple afferent lymphatic vessels and from there flows into a
series of sinuses.[3] After entering the lymph node from afferent
lymphatic vessels, lymph flows into a space underneath the
capsule called the subcapsular sinus, then into cortical
sinuses.[3] After passing through the cortex, lymph then collects

efferent lymph vessels to exit the node at the hilum on the

Lymph nodes are present throughout the body, are more
concentrated near and within the trunk, and are divided into
groups.[4] There are about 450 lymph nodes in the adult.[4]
Some lymph nodes can be felt when enlarged (and occasionally
when not), such as the axillary lymph nodes under the arm, the
cervical lymph nodes of the head and neck and the inguinal
lymph nodes near the groin crease. Most lymph nodes lie
within the trunk adjacent to other major structures in the body -
such as the paraaortic lymph nodes and the tracheobronchial
lymph nodes. The lymphatic drainage patterns are different from
person to person and even asymmetrical on each side of the
same body.[5][6]
Location
There are no lymph nodes in the central nervous system, which is separated from the body by the blood–
brain barrier. Lymph from the meningeal lymphatic vessels in the CNS drains to the deep cervical lymph
nodes.[7]

A lymph node is divided into compartments called nodules (or lobules), each consisting of a region of
cortex with combined follicle B cells, a paracortex of T cells, and a part of the nodule in the medulla.[15]
The substance of a lymph node is divided into the outer cortex and the inner medulla.[3] The cortex of a
lymph node is the outer portion of the node, underneath the capsule and the subcapsular sinus.[15] It has an
outer part and a deeper part known as the paracortex.[15] The outer cortex consists of groups of mainly
inactivated B cells called follicles.[4] When activated, these may develop into what is called a germinal
centre.[4] The deeper paracortex mainly consists of the T cells.[4] Here the T-cells mainly interact with
dendritic cells, and the reticular network is dense.[16]

The medulla contains large blood vessels, sinuses and medullary
cords that contain antibody-secreting plasma cells. There are
fewer cells in the medulla.[4]
The medullary cords are cords of lymphatic tissue, and include
plasma cells, macrophages, and B cells.
In the lymphatic system a lymph node is a secondary lymphoid
organ.[4] Lymph nodes contain lymphocytes, a type of white
blood cell, and are primarily made up of B cells and T cells.[4] B
cells are mainly found in the outer cortex where they are clustered
together as follicular B cells in lymphoid follicles, and T cells and dendritic cells are mainly found in the
paracortex.[17]
There are fewer cells in the medulla than the cortex.[4] The medulla contains plasma cells, as well as
macrophages which are present within the medullary sinuses.[17]
As part of the reticular network, there are follicular dendritic cells in the B cell follicle and fibroblastic
reticular cells in the T cell cortex. The reticular network provides structural support and a surface for
adhesion of the dendritic cells, macrophages and lymphocytes. It also allows exchange of material with
blood through the high endothelial venules and provides the growth and regulatory factors necessary for
activation and maturation of immune cells.[18]
Lymph enters the convex side of a lymph node through multiple
afferent lymphatic vessels, which form a network of lymphatic
vessels (Latin: plexus) and from here flows into a space (Latin:
sinus) underneath the capsule called the subcapsular sinus.[4][3]
From here, lymph flows into sinuses within the cortex.[3] After
passing through the cortex, lymph then collects in medullary
sinuses.[3] All of these sinuses drain into the efferent lymphatic
vessels to exit the node at the hilum on the concave side.[3]
These are channels within the node lined by endothelial cells along
with fibroblastic reticular cells, allowing for the smooth flow of
lymph. The endothelium of the subcapsular sinus is continuous with
that of the afferent lymph vessel and also with that of the similar
sinuses flanking the trabeculae and within the cortex. These vessels are smaller and do not allow the
passage of macrophages so that they remain contained to function within a lymph node. In the course of the
lymph, lymphocytes may be activated as part of the adaptive immune response.
There is usually only one efferent vessel though sometimes there may be two.[19] Medullary sinuses contain
histiocytes (immobile macrophages) and reticular cells.

A lymph node contains lymphoid tissue, i.e., a
meshwork or fibers called reticulum with white blood
cells enmeshed in it. The regions where there are few
cells within the meshwork are known as lymph sinus.
It is lined by reticular cells, fibroblasts and fixed
macrophages.[20]
Thin reticular fibers (reticulin) of reticular connective
tissue form a supporting meshwork inside the node.[4]
The lymph node capsule is composed of dense irregular connective
tissue with some plain collagenous fibers, and a number of
membranous processes or trabeculae extend from its internal
surface. The trabeculae pass inward, radiating toward the center of
the node, for about one-third or one-fourth of the space between the
circumference and the center of the node. In some animals they are
sufficiently well-marked to divide the peripheral or cortical portion
of the node into a number of compartments (nodules), but in
humans this arrangement is not obvious. The larger trabeculae
springing from the capsule break up into finer bands, and these
interlace to form a mesh-work in the central or medullary portion of
the node. These trabecular spaces formed by the interlacing
trabeculae contain the proper lymph node substance or lymphoid tissue. The node pulp does not, however,
completely fill the spaces, but leaves between its outer margin and the enclosing trabeculae a channel or
space of uniform width throughout. This is termed the subcapsular sinus (lymph path or lymph sinus).
Running across it are a number of finer trabeculae of reticular fibers, mostly covered by ramifying cells.
In the lymphatic system a lymph node is a secondary lymphoid organ.[4]
The primary function of lymph nodes is the filtering of lymph to
identify and fight infection. In order to do this, lymph nodes contain
lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, which includes B cells and
T cells. These circulate through the bloodstream and enter and
reside in lymph nodes.[21] B cells produce antibodies. Each
antibody has a single predetermined target, an antigen, that it can
bind to. These circulate throughout the bloodstream and if they find
this target, the antibodies bind to it and stimulate an immune
response. Each B cell produces different antibodies, and this
process is driven in lymph nodes. B cells enter the bloodstream as
"naive" cells produced in bone marrow. After entering a lymph
node, they then enter a lymphoid follicle, where they multiply and
divide, each producing a different antibody. If a cell is stimulated, it
will go on to produce more antibodies (a plasma cell) or act as a memory cell to help the body fight future
infection.[22] If a cell is not stimulated, it will undergo apoptosis and die.[22]

Antigens are molecules found on bacterial cell walls, chemical substances secreted from bacteria, or
sometimes even molecules present in body tissue itself. These are taken up by cells throughout the body
called antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells.[23] These antigen presenting cells enter the lymph
system and then lymph nodes. They present the antigen to T cells and, if there is a T cell with the
appropriate T cell receptor, it will be activated.[22]
B cells acquire antigen directly from the afferent lymph. If a B cell binds its cognate antigen it will be
activated. Some B cells will immediately develop into antibody secreting plasma cells, and secrete IgM.
Other B cells will internalize the antigen and present it to follicular helper T cells on the B and T cell zone
interface. If a cognate FTh cell is found it will upregulate CD40L and promote somatic hypermutation and
isotype class switching of the B cell, increasing its antigen binding affinity and changing its effector
function. Proliferation of cells within a lymph node will make the node expand.
Lymph is present throughout the body, and circulates through lymphatic vessels. These drain into and from
lymph nodes – afferent vessels drain into nodes, and efferent vessels from nodes. When lymph fluid enters a
node, it drains into the node just beneath the capsule in a space called the subcapsular sinus. The
subcapsular sinus drains into trabecular sinuses and finally into medullary sinuses. The sinus space is criss-
crossed by the pseudopods of macrophages, which act to trap foreign particles and filter the lymph. The
medullary sinuses converge at the hilum and lymph then leaves the lymph node via the efferent lymphatic
vessel towards either a more central lymph node or ultimately for drainage into a central venous subclavian
blood vessel.
The B cells migrate to the nodular cortex and medulla.
The T cells migrate to the deep cortex. This is a region of a lymph node called the
paracortex that immediately surrounds the medulla. Because both naive T cells and
dendritic cells express CCR7, they are drawn into the paracortex by the same chemotactic
factors, increasing the chance of T cell activation. Both B and T lymphocytes enter lymph
nodes from circulating blood through specialized high endothelial venules found in the
paracortex.

enlargement

swelling 
is 
known 
as
lymphadenopathy.[24] Swelling may be due to many causes, including
infections, tumors, autoimmune disease, drug reactions, diseases such
as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis, or because of lymphoma or
leukemia.[25][24] Depending on the cause, swelling may be painful,
particularly if the expansion is rapid and due to an infection or
inflammation.[24] Lymph node enlargement may be localised to an
area, which might suggest a local source of infection or a tumour in
that area that has spread to the lymph node.[24] It may also be
generalised, which might suggest infection, connective tissue or
autoimmune disease, or a malignancy of blood cells such as a lymphoma or leukaemia.[24] Rarely,
depending on location, lymph node enlargement may cause problems such as difficulty breathing, or
compression of a blood vessel (for example, superior vena cava obstruction[26]).

Enlarged lymph nodes might be felt as part of a medical examination, or found on medical imaging.[27]
Features of the medical history may point to the cause, such as the speed of onset of swelling, pain, and
other constitutional symptoms such as fevers or weight loss.[28] For example, a tumour of the breast may
result in swelling of the lymph nodes under the arms[24] and weight loss and night sweats may suggest a
malignancy such as lymphoma.[24]
In addition to a medical exam by a medical practitioner, medical tests may include blood tests and scans
may be needed to further examine the cause.[24] A biopsy of a lymph node may also be needed.[24]
Lymph nodes can be affected by both primary cancers of lymph tissue,
and secondary cancers affecting other parts of the body. Primary
cancers of lymph tissue are called lymphomas and include Hodgkin
lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.[29] Cancer of lymph nodes
can cause a wide range of symptoms from painless long-term slowly
growing swelling to sudden, rapid enlargement over days or weeks,
with symptoms depending on the grade of the tumour.[29] Most
lymphomas are tumours of B-cells.[29] Lymphoma is managed by
haematologists and oncologists.
Local cancer in many parts of the body can cause lymph nodes to
enlarge because of tumorous cells that have metastasised into the node.[30] Lymph node involvement is
often a key part in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, acting as "sentinels" of local disease, incorporated
into TNM staging and other cancer staging systems. As part of the investigations or workup for cancer,
lymph nodes may be imaged or even surgically removed. If removed, the lymph node will be stained and
examined under a microscope by a pathologist to determine if there is evidence of cells that appear
cancerous (i.e. have metastasized into the node). The staging of the cancer, and therefore the treatment
approach and prognosis, is predicated on the presence of node metastases.
Lymphedema is the condition of swelling (edema) of tissue relating to insufficient clearance by the
lymphatic system.[31] It can be congenital as a result usually of undeveloped or absent lymph nodes, and is
known as primary lymphedema. Lymphedema most commonly arises in the arms or legs, but can also occur
in the chest wall, genitals, neck, and abdomen.[32] Secondary lymphedema usually results from the removal
of lymph nodes during breast cancer surgery or from other damaging treatments such as radiation. It can
also be caused by some parasitic infections. Affected tissues are at a great risk of infection. Management of
lymphedema may include advice to lose weight, exercise, keep the affected limb moist, and compress the
affected area.[31] Sometimes surgical management is also considered.[31]
The spleen and the tonsils are the larger secondary lymphoid organs that serve somewhat similar functions
to lymph nodes, though the spleen filters blood cells rather than lymph. The tonsils are sometimes
erroneously referred to as lymph nodes. Although the tonsils and lymph nodes do share certain

characteristics, there are also many important differences between them, such as their location, structure and
size.[33] Furthermore, the tonsils filter tissue fluid whereas lymph nodes filter lymph.[33]
The appendix contains lymphoid tissue and is therefore believed to play a role not only in the digestive
system, but also in the immune system.[34]
