Programmed cell death
Programmed cell death (PCD; sometimes referred to as cellular suicide[1]) is the death of a cell as a
result of events inside of a cell, such as apoptosis or autophagy.[2][3] PCD is carried out in a biological
process, which usually confers advantage during an organism's lifecycle. For example, the differentiation of
fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the fingers apoptose; the
result is that the digits are separate. PCD serves fundamental functions during both plant and animal tissue
development.
Apoptosis and autophagy are both forms of programmed cell death.[4] Necrosis is the death of a cell caused
by external factors such as trauma or infection and occurs in several different forms. Necrosis was long seen
as a non-physiological process that occurs as a result of infection or injury,[4] but in the 2000s, a form of
programmed necrosis, called necroptosis,[5] was recognized as an alternative form of programmed cell
death. It is hypothesized that necroptosis can serve as a cell-death backup to apoptosis when the apoptosis
signaling is blocked by endogenous or exogenous factors such as viruses or mutations. Most recently, other
types of regulated necrosis have been discovered as well, which share several signaling events with
necroptosis and apoptosis.[6]
The concept of "programmed cell-death" was used by Lockshin & Williams[7] in 1964 in relation to insect
tissue development, around eight years before "apoptosis" was coined. The term PCD has, however, been a
source of confusion and Durand and Ramsey[8] have developed the concept by providing mechanistic and
evolutionary definitions. PCD has become the general terms that refers to all the different types of cell death
that have a genetic component.
The first insight into the mechanism came from studying BCL2, the product of a putative oncogene
activated by chromosome translocations often found in follicular lymphoma. Unlike other cancer genes,
which promote cancer by stimulating cell proliferation, BCL2 promoted cancer by stopping lymphoma cells
from being able to kill themselves.[9]
PCD has been the subject of increasing attention and research efforts. This trend has been highlighted with
the award of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Sydney Brenner (United Kingdom), H.
Robert Horvitz (US) and John E. Sulston (UK).[10]

Apoptosis
Overview of signal transduction
pathways involved in apoptosis
Apoptosis is the process of programmed cell death (PCD) that may
occur in multicellular organisms.[12] Biochemical events lead to
characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes
include blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin
condensation, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation. It is now
thought that- in a developmental context- cells are induced to
positively commit suicide whilst in a homeostatic context; the
absence of certain survival factors may provide the impetus for
suicide. There appears to be some variation in the morphology and
indeed the biochemistry of these suicide pathways; some treading
the path of "apoptosis", others following a more generalized
pathway to deletion, but both usually being genetically and
synthetically motivated. There is some evidence that certain symptoms of "apoptosis" such as endonuclease
activation can be spuriously induced without engaging a genetic cascade, however, presumably true
apoptosis and programmed cell death must be genetically mediated. It is also becoming clear that mitosis
and apoptosis are toggled or linked in some way and that the balance achieved depends on signals received
from appropriate growth or survival factors.[13]
There are two different potential pathways that may be followed when apoptosis is needed. There is the
extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic pathway. Both pathways involve the use of caspases - crucial to cell
death.
The extrinsic pathway involves specific receptor ligand interaction. Either the FAS ligand binds to the FAS
receptor or the TNF-alpha ligand can bind to the TNF receptor. In both situations there is the activation of
initiator caspase. The extrinsic pathway can be activated in two ways. The first way is through fast ligan
TNF-alpha binding or through a cytotoxic t-cell. The cytotoxic T-cell can attach itself to a membrane,
facilitating the release of granzyme B. Granzyme B perforates the target cell membrane and in turn allows
the release of perforin. Finally, perforin creates a pore in the membrane, and releases the caspases which
leads to the activation of caspase 3. This initiator caspase may cause the cleaving of inactive caspase 3,
causing it to become cleaved caspase 3. This is the final molecule needed to trigger cell death.[14]
The intrinsic pathway is caused by cell damage such as DNA damage or UV exposure. This pathway takes
place in the mitochondria and is mediated by sensors called Bcl sensors, and two proteins called BAX and
BAK. These proteins are found in a majority of higher mammals as they are able to pierce the
mitochondrial outer membrane - making them an integral part of mediating cell death by apoptosis. They do
this by orchestrating the formation of pores within the membrane - essential to the release of cytochrome c.
However, cytochrome c is only released if the mitochondrial membrane is compromised. Once cytochrome
c is detected, the apoptosome complex is formed. This complex activates the executioner caspase which
causes cell death. This killing of the cells may be essential as it prevents cellular overgrowth which can
result in disease such as cancer. There are another two proteins worth mentioning that inhibit the release of
cytochrome c in the mitochondria. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl are anti-apoptotic and therefore prevent cell death.
Extrinsic Vs. Intrinsic Pathways[edit]
Extrinsic Pathway[edit]
Intrinsic Pathway[edit]
There is a potential mutation that can occur in that causes the overactivity of Bcl-2. It is the translocation
between chromosomes 14 and 18. This over activity can result in the development of follicular
lymphoma.[15]
Macroautophagy, often referred to as autophagy, is a catabolic process that results in the autophagosomic-
lysosomal degradation of bulk cytoplasmic contents, abnormal protein aggregates, and excess or damaged
organelles.
Autophagy is generally activated by conditions of nutrient deprivation but has also been associated with
physiological as well as pathological processes such as development, differentiation, neurodegenerative
diseases, stress, infection and cancer.
A critical regulator of autophagy induction is the kinase mTOR, which when activated, suppresses
autophagy and when not activated promotes it. Three related serine/threonine kinases, UNC-51-like kinase
-1, -2, and -3 (ULK1, ULK2, UKL3), which play a similar role as the yeast Atg1, act downstream of the
mTOR complex. ULK1 and ULK2 form a large complex with the mammalian homolog of an autophagy-
related (Atg) gene product (mAtg13) and the scaffold protein FIP200. Class III PI3K complex, containing
hVps34, Beclin-1, p150 and Atg14-like protein or ultraviolet irradiation resistance-associated gene
(UVRAG), is required for the induction of autophagy.
The ATG genes control the autophagosome formation through ATG12-ATG5 and LC3-II (ATG8-II)
complexes. ATG12 is conjugated to ATG5 in a ubiquitin-like reaction that requires ATG7 and ATG10. The
Atg12â€“Atg5 conjugate then interacts non-covalently with ATG16 to form a large complex. LC3/ATG8 is
cleaved at its C terminus by ATG4 protease to generate the cytosolic LC3-I. LC3-I is conjugated to
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) also in a ubiquitin-like reaction that requires Atg7 and Atg3. The lipidated
form of LC3, known as LC3-II, is attached to the autophagosome membrane.
Autophagy and apoptosis are connected both positively and negatively, and extensive crosstalk exists
between the two. During nutrient deficiency, autophagy functions as a pro-survival mechanism, however,
excessive autophagy may lead to cell death, a process morphologically distinct from apoptosis. Several pro-
apoptotic signals, such as TNF, TRAIL, and FADD, also induce autophagy. Additionally, Bcl-2 inhibits
Beclin-1-dependent autophagy, thereby functioning both as a pro-survival and as an anti-autophagic
regulator.
Besides the above two types of PCD, other pathways have been discovered.[16] Called "non-apoptotic
programmed cell-death" (or "caspase-independent programmed cell-death" or "necroptosis"), these
alternative routes to death are as efficient as apoptosis and can function as either backup mechanisms or the
main type of PCD.
Other forms of programmed cell death include anoikis, almost identical to apoptosis except in its induction;
cornification, a form of cell death exclusive to the epidermis; excitotoxicity; ferroptosis, an iron-dependent
form of cell death[17] and Wallerian degeneration.

Other types
Necroptosis is a programmed form of necrosis, or inflammatory cell death. Conventionally, necrosis is
associated with unprogrammed cell death resulting from cellular damage or infiltration by pathogens, in
contrast to orderly, programmed cell death via apoptosis. Nemosis is another programmed form of necrosis
that takes place in fibroblasts.[18]
Eryptosis is a form of suicidal erythrocyte death.[19]
Aponecrosis is a hybrid of apoptosis and necrosis and refers to an incomplete apoptotic process that is
completed by necrosis.[20]
NETosis is the process of cell-death generated by NETs.[21]
Paraptosis is another type of nonapoptotic cell death that is mediated by MAPK through the activation of
IGF-1. It's characterized by the intracellular formation of vacuoles and swelling of mitochondria.[22]
Pyroptosis, an inflammatory type of cell death, is uniquely mediated by caspase 1, an enzyme not involved
in apoptosis, in response to infection by certain microorganisms.[22]
Plant cells undergo particular processes of PCD similar to autophagic cell death. However, some common
features of PCD are highly conserved in both plants and metazoa.
An atrophic factor is a force that causes a cell to die. Only natural forces on the cell are considered to be
atrophic factors, whereas, for example, agents of mechanical or chemical abuse or lysis of the cell are
considered not to be atrophic factors. Common types of atrophic factors are:[23]
1. Decreased workload
2. Loss of innervation
3. Diminished blood supply
4. Inadequate nutrition
5. Loss of endocrine stimulation
6. Senility
7. Compression
The initial expansion of the developing nervous system is counterbalanced by the removal of neurons and
their processes.[24] During the development of the nervous system almost 50% of developing neurons are
naturally removed by programmed cell death (PCD).[25] PCD in the nervous system was first recognized in
1896 by John Beard.[26] Since then several theories were proposed to understand its biological significance
during neural development.[27]
PCD in the developing nervous system has been observed in proliferating as well as post-mitotic cells.[24]
One theory suggests that PCD is an adaptive mechanism to regulate the number of progenitor cells. In
humans, PCD in progenitor cells starts at gestational week 7 and remains until the first trimester.[28] This

process of cell death has been identified in the germinal areas of the
cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord
among other regions.[27] At gestational weeks 19â€“23, PCD is
observed in post-mitotic cells.[29] The prevailing theory explaining
this observation is the neurotrophic theory which states that PCD is
required to optimize the connection between neurons and their
afferent inputs and efferent targets.[27] Another theory proposes that
developmental PCD in the nervous system occurs in order to
correct for errors in neurons that have migrated ectopically,
innervated incorrect targets, or have axons that have gone awry
during path finding.[30] It is possible that PCD during the
development of the nervous system serves different functions
determined by the developmental stage, cell type, and even
species.[27]
The neurotrophic theory is the leading hypothesis used to explain
the role of programmed cell death in the developing nervous
system.[31] It postulates that in order to ensure optimal innervation
of targets, a surplus of neurons is first produced which then
compete for limited quantities of protective neurotrophic factors and
only a fraction survive while others die by programmed cell
death.[28] Furthermore, the theory states that predetermined factors
regulate the amount of neurons that survive and the size of the innervating neuronal population directly
correlates to the influence of their target field.[32]
The underlying idea that target cells secrete attractive or inducing factors and that their growth cones have a
chemotactic sensitivity was first put forth by Santiago Ramon y Cajal in 1892.[33] Cajal presented the idea
as an explanation for the "intelligent force" axons appear to take when finding their target but admitted that
he had no empirical data.[33] The theory gained more attraction when experimental manipulation of axon
targets yielded death of all innervating neurons. This developed the concept of target derived regulation
which became the main tenet in the neurotrophic theory.[34][35] Experiments that further supported this
theory led to the identification of the first neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor (NGF).[36]
Different mechanisms regulate PCD in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) versus the central nervous
system (CNS). In the PNS, innervation of the target is proportional to the amount of the target-released
neurotrophic factors NGF and NT3.[37][38] Expression of neurotrophin receptors, TrkA and TrkC, is
sufficient to induce apoptosis in the absence of their ligands.[25] Therefore, it is speculated that PCD in the
PNS is dependent on the release of neurotrophic factors and thus follows the concept of the neurotrophic
theory.
Programmed cell death in the CNS is not dependent on external growth factors but instead relies on
intrinsically derived cues. In the neocortex, a 4:1 ratio of excitatory to inhibitory interneurons is maintained
by apoptotic machinery that appears to be independent of the environment.[38] Supporting evidence came
The neurotrophic theory
Peripheral versus central nervous system
Cell death in the peripheral vs central
nervous system
from an experiment where interneuron progenitors were either
transplanted into the mouse neocortex or cultured in vitro.[39]
Transplanted cells died at the age of two weeks, the same age at
which endogenous interneurons undergo apoptosis. Regardless of
the size of the transplant, the fraction of cells undergoing apoptosis
remained constant. Furthermore, disruption of TrkB, a receptor for
brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), did not affect cell death. It
has also been shown that in mice null for the proapoptotic factor
Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) a larger percentage of
interneurons survived compared to wild type mice.[39] Together
these findings indicate that programmed cell death in the CNS
partly exploits Bax-mediated signaling and is independent of
BDNF and the environment. Apoptotic mechanisms in the CNS are
still not well understood, yet it is thought that apoptosis of
interneurons is a self-autonomous process.
Programmed cell death can be reduced or eliminated in the developing nervous system by the targeted
deletion of pro-apoptotic genes or by the overexpression of anti-apoptotic genes. The absence or reduction
of PCD can cause serious anatomical malformations but can also result in minimal consequences depending
on the gene targeted, neuronal population, and stage of development.[27] Excess progenitor cell
proliferation that leads to gross brain abnormalities is often lethal, as seen in caspase-3 or caspase-9
knockout mice which develop exencephaly in the forebrain.[40][41] The brainstem, spinal cord, and
peripheral ganglia of these mice develop normally, however, suggesting that the involvement of caspases in
PCD during development depends on the brain region and cell type.[42] Knockout or inhibition of apoptotic
protease activating factor 1 (APAF1), also results in malformations and increased embryonic
lethality.[43][44][45] Manipulation of apoptosis regulator proteins Bcl-2 and Bax (overexpression of Bcl-2 or
deletion of Bax) produces an increase in the number of neurons in certain regions of the nervous system
such as the retina, trigeminal nucleus, cerebellum, and spinal cord.[46][47][48][49][50][51][52] However, PCD
of neurons due to Bax deletion or Bcl-2 overexpression does not result in prominent morphological or
behavioral abnormalities in mice. For example, mice overexpressing Bcl-2 have generally normal motor
skills and vision and only show impairment in complex behaviors such as learning and anxiety.[53][54][55]
The normal behavioral phenotypes of these mice suggest that an adaptive mechanism may be involved to
compensate for the excess neurons.[27]
Learning about PCD in various species is essential in understanding the evolutionary basis and reason for
apoptosis in development of the nervous system. During the development of the invertebrate nervous
system, PCD plays different roles in different species.[56] The similarity of the asymmetric cell death
mechanism in the nematode and the leech indicates that PCD may have an evolutionary significance in the
development of the nervous system.[57] In the nematode, PCD occurs in the first hour of development
leading to the elimination of 12% of non-gonadal cells including neuronal lineages.[58] Cell death in
arthropods occurs first in the nervous system when ectoderm cells differentiate and one daughter cell

Invertebrates and vertebrates
A conserved apoptotic pathway in
nematodes, mammals and fruitflies
becomes a neuroblast and the other undergoes apoptosis.[59]
Furthermore, sex targeted cell death leads to different neuronal
innervation of specific organs in males and females.[60] In
Drosophila, PCD is essential in segmentation and specification
during development.
In contrast to invertebrates, the mechanism of programmed cell
death is found to be more conserved in vertebrates. Extensive
studies performed on various vertebrates show that PCD of neurons
and glia occurs in most parts of the nervous system during
development. 
It 
has 
been 
observed 
before 
and 
during
synaptogenesis in the central nervous system as well as the
peripheral nervous system.[27] However, there are a few differences between vertebrate species. For
example, mammals exhibit extensive arborization followed by PCD in the retina while birds do not.[61]
Although synaptic refinement in vertebrate systems is largely dependent on PCD, other evolutionary
mechanisms also play a role.[27]
Programmed cell death in plants has a number of molecular similarities to animal apoptosis, but it also has
differences, the most obvious being the presence of a cell wall and the lack of an immune system that
removes the pieces of the dead cell. Instead of an immune response, the dying cell synthesizes substances to
break itself down and places them in a vacuole that ruptures as the cell dies.[62]
In "APL regulates vascular tissue identity in Arabidopsis",[63] Martin Bonke and his colleagues had stated
that one of the two long-distance transport systems in vascular plants, xylem, consists of several cell-types
"the differentiation of which involves deposition of elaborate cell-wall thickenings and programmed cell-
death." The authors emphasize that the products of plant PCD play an important structural role.
Basic morphological and biochemical features of PCD have been conserved in both plant and animal
kingdoms.[64] Specific types of plant cells carry out unique cell-death programs. These have common
features with animal apoptosisâ€”for instance, nuclear DNA degradationâ€”but they also have their own
peculiarities, such as nuclear degradation triggered by the collapse of the vacuole in tracheary elements of
the xylem.[65]
Janneke Balk and Christopher J. Leaver, of the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, carried
out research on mutations in the mitochondrial genome of sun-flower cells. Results of this research suggest
that mitochondria play the same key role in vascular plant PCD as in other eukaryotic cells.[66]
In plant tissue
PCD in pollen prevents inbreeding
During pollination, plants enforce self-incompatibility (SI) as an important means to prevent self-
fertilization. Research on the corn poppy (Papaver rhoeas) has revealed that proteins in the pistil on which
the pollen lands, interact with pollen and trigger PCD in incompatible (i.e., self) pollen. The researchers,
Steven G. Thomas and Vernonica E. Franklin-Tong, also found that the response involves rapid inhibition
of pollen-tube growth, followed by PCD.[67]
The social slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum has the peculiarity of either adopting a predatory amoeba-
like behavior in its unicellular form or coalescing into a mobile slug-like form when dispersing the spores
that will give birth to the next generation.[68]
The stalk is composed of dead cells that have undergone a type of PCD that shares many features of an
autophagic cell-death: massive vacuoles forming inside cells, a degree of chromatin condensation, but no
DNA fragmentation.[69] The structural role of the residues left by the dead cells is reminiscent of the
products of PCD in plant tissue.
D. discoideum is a slime mold, part of a branch that might have emerged from eukaryotic ancestors about a
billion years before the present. It seems that they emerged after the ancestors of green plants and the
ancestors of fungi and animals had differentiated. But, in addition to their place in the evolutionary tree, the
fact that PCD has been observed in the humble, simple, six-chromosome D. discoideum has additional
significance: It permits the study of a developmental PCD path that does not depend on caspases
characteristic of apoptosis.[70]
The occurrence of programmed cell death in protists is possible,[71][72] but it remains controversial. Some
categorize death in those organisms as unregulated apoptosis-like cell death.[73][74]
Biologists had long suspected that mitochondria originated from bacteria that had been incorporated as
endosymbionts ("living together inside") of larger eukaryotic cells. It was Lynn Margulis who from 1967 on
championed this theory, which has since become widely accepted.[75] The most convincing evidence for
this theory is the fact that mitochondria possess their own DNA and are equipped with genes and replication
apparatus.
This evolutionary step would have been risky for the primitive eukaryotic cells, which began to engulf the
energy-producing bacteria, as well as a perilous step for the ancestors of mitochondria, which began to
invade their proto-eukaryotic hosts. This process is still evident today, between human white blood cells and
bacteria. Most of the time, invading bacteria are destroyed by the white blood cells; however, it is not
uncommon for the chemical warfare waged by prokaryotes to succeed, with the consequence known as
infection by its resulting damage.
One of these rare evolutionary events, about two billion years before the present, made it possible for
certain eukaryotes and energy-producing prokaryotes to coexist and mutually benefit from their
symbiosis.[76]
In slime molds
Evolutionary origin of mitochondrial apoptosis
Oxidative stress or environmental insults can lead to DNA damage in replicating cells
and this can result in apoptosis or cancer.
Mitochondriate eukaryotic cells live poised between life and death, because mitochondria still retain their
repertoire of molecules that can trigger cell suicide.[77] It is not clear why apoptotic machinery is maintained
in the extant unicellular organisms. This process has now been evolved to happen only when
programmed.[78] to cells (such as feedback from neighbors, stress or DNA damage), mitochondria release
caspase activators that trigger the cell-death-inducing biochemical cascade. As such, the cell suicide
mechanism is now crucial to all of our lives.
Repair of DNA damages and apoptosis are two enzymatic processes essential for maintaining genome
integrity in humans. Cells that are deficient in DNA repair tend to accumulate DNA damages, and when
such cells are also defective in apoptosis they tend to survive even with excess DNA damage.[79]
Replication of DNA in such cells leads to mutations and these mutations may cause cancer (see Figure).
Several enzymatic pathways have evolved for repairing different kinds of DNA damage, and it has been
found that in five well studied DNA repair pathways particular enzymes have a dual role, where one role is
to participate in repair of a specific class of damages and the second role is to induce apoptosis if the level of
such DNA damage is beyond the cellâ€™s repair capability.[79] These dual role proteins tend to protect against
development of cancer. Proteins that function in such a dual role for each repair process are: (1) DNA
mismatch repair, MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2; (2) base excision repair, APEX1 (REF1/APE),
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP); (3) nucleotide excision repair, XPB, XPD (ERCC2), p53,
p33(ING1b); (4) non-homologous end joining, the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK; (5) homologous
recombinational repair, BRCA1, ATM, ATR, WRN, BLM, Tip60, p53.
The BCR-ABL oncogene has been found to be involved in the development of cancer in humans.[80]
