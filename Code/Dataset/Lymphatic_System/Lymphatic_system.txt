Anatomical terminology
Lymphatic system
The lymphatic system, or lymphoid system, is an organ
system in vertebrates that is part of the immune system, and
complementary to the circulatory system. It consists of a large
network of lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, lymphoid organs,
lymphatic tissue and lymph.[1][2] Lymph is a clear fluid carried
by the lymphatic vessels back to the heart for re-circulation.
The Latin word for lymph, lympha, refers to the deity of fresh
water, "Lympha".[3]
Unlike the circulatory system that is a closed system, the
lymphatic system is open.[4][5] The human circulatory system
processes an average of 20 litres of blood per day through
capillary filtration, which removes plasma from the blood.
Roughly 17 litres of the filtered blood is reabsorbed directly
into the blood vessels, while the remaining three litres are left in
the interstitial fluid. One of the main functions of the lymphatic
system is to provide an accessory return route to the blood for
the surplus three litres.[6]
The other main function is that of immune defense. Lymph is
very similar to blood plasma, in that it contains waste products
and cellular debris, together with bacteria and proteins. The
cells of the lymph are mostly lymphocytes. Associated
lymphoid organs are composed of lymphoid tissue, and are the
sites either of lymphocyte production or of lymphocyte
activation. These include the lymph nodes (where the highest
lymphocyte concentration is found), the spleen, the thymus, and
the tonsils. Lymphocytes are initially generated in the bone
marrow. The lymphoid organs also contain other types of cells
such as stromal cells for support.[7] Lymphoid tissue is also
associated with mucosas such as mucosa-associated lymphoid
tissue (MALT).[8]
Fluid from circulating blood leaks into the tissues of the body
by capillary action, carrying nutrients to the cells. The fluid
bathes the tissues as interstitial fluid, collecting waste products,
bacteria, and damaged cells, and then drains as lymph into the lymphatic capillaries and lymphatic vessels.
These vessels carry the lymph throughout the body, passing through numerous lymph nodes which filter out
unwanted materials such as bacteria and damaged cells. Lymph then passes into much larger lymph vessels
known as lymph ducts. The right lymphatic duct drains the right side of the region and the much larger left
Anatomy of the lymphatic system showing primary
and secondary lymphoid organs
lymphatic duct, known as the thoracic duct, drains the left side of the body. The ducts empty into the
subclavian veins to return to the blood circulation. Lymph is moved through the system by muscle
contractions.[9] In some vertebrates, a lymph heart is present that pumps the lymph to the veins.[9][10]
The lymphatic system was first described in the 17th century independently by Olaus Rudbeck and Thomas
Bartholin.[11]
The lymphatic system consists of a conducting
network of lymphatic vessels, lymphoid organs,
lymphoid tissues, and the circulating lymph.[1]
The primary (or central) lymphoid organs generate
lymphocytes from immature progenitor cells. The
thymus and the bone marrow constitute the primary
lymphoid organs involved in the production and early
clonal selection of lymphocyte tissues.
Bone marrow is responsible for both the creation of T
cell precursors and the production and maturation of
B cells, which are important cell types of the immune
system. From the bone marrow, B cells immediately
join the circulatory system and travel to secondary
lymphoid organs in search of pathogens. T cells, on
the other hand, travel from the bone marrow to the
thymus, where they develop further and mature.
Mature T cells then join B cells in search of
pathogens. The other 95% of T cells begin a process
of apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death.
The thymus increases in size from birth in response to postnatal antigen stimulation. It is most active during
the neonatal and pre-adolescent periods. The thymus is located between the inferior neck and the superior
thorax. At puberty, by the early teens, the thymus begins to atrophy and regress, with adipose tissue mostly
replacing the thymic stroma. However, residual T cell lymphopoiesis continues throughout adult life,
providing some immune response. The thymus is where the T lymphocytes mature and become
immunocompetent. The loss or lack of the thymus results in severe immunodeficiency and subsequent high
susceptibility to infection. In most species, the thymus consists of lobules divided by septa which are made
up of epithelium which is often considered an epithelial organ. T cells mature from thymocytes, proliferate,
and undergo a selection process in the thymic cortex before entering the medulla to interact with epithelial
cells.

Primary lymphoid organs
Bone marrow
Thymus
Research on bony fish showed a buildup of T cells in the thymus and spleen of lymphoid tissues in salmon
and showed that there are not many T cells in non-lymphoid tissues.[12]
The thymus provides an inductive environment for the development of T cells from hematopoietic
progenitor cells. In addition, thymic stromal cells allow for the selection of a functional and self-tolerant T
cell repertoire. Therefore, one of the most important roles of the thymus is the induction of central tolerance.
However, the thymus is not where the infection is fought, as the T cells have yet to become
immunocompetent.
The secondary (or peripheral) lymphoid organs, which include lymph nodes and the spleen, maintain
mature naive lymphocytes and initiate an adaptive immune response.[13] The secondary lymphoid organs
are the sites of lymphocyte activation by antigens.[14] Activation leads to clonal expansion, and affinity
maturation. Mature lymphocytes recirculate between the blood and the secondary lymphoid organs until
they encounter their specific antigen.
The main functions of the spleen are:
1. to produce immune cells to fight antigens
2. to remove particulate matter and aged blood cells, mainly red blood cells
3. to produce blood cells during fetal life.
The spleen synthesizes antibodies in its white pulp and removes antibody-coated bacteria and antibody-
coated blood cells by way of blood and lymph node circulation. The white pulp of the spleen provides
immune function due to the lymphocytes that are housed there. The spleen also consists of red pulp which
is responsible for getting rid of aged red blood cells, as well as pathogens. This is carried out by
macrophages present in the red pulp. A study published in 2009 using mice found that the spleen contains,
in its reserve, half of the body's monocytes within the red pulp.[15] These monocytes, upon moving to
injured tissue (such as the heart), turn into dendritic cells and macrophages while promoting tissue
healing.[15][16][17] The spleen is a center of activity of the mononuclear phagocyte system and can be
considered analogous to a large lymph node, as its absence causes a predisposition to certain infections.
Notably, the spleen is important for a multitude of functions. The spleen removes pathogens and old
erythrocytes from the blood (red pulp) and produces lymphocytes for immune response (white pulp). The
spleen also is responsible for recycling some erythrocytes components and discarding others. For example,
hemoglobin is broken down into amino acids that are reused.
Research on bony fish has shown that a high concentration of T cells are found in the white pulp of the
spleen.[12]
Like the thymus, the spleen has only efferent lymphatic vessels. Both the short gastric arteries and the
splenic artery supply it with blood.[18] The germinal centers are supplied by arterioles called penicilliary
radicles.[19]
In the human until the fifth month of prenatal development, the spleen creates red blood cells; after birth, the
bone marrow is solely responsible for hematopoiesis. As a major lymphoid organ and a central player in the
reticuloendothelial system, the spleen retains the ability to produce lymphocytes. The spleen stores red

blood cells and lymphocytes. It can store enough blood cells to help in an emergency. Up to 25% of
lymphocytes can be stored at any one time.[20]
A lymph node is an organized collection of
lymphoid tissue, through which the lymph
passes on its way back to the blood. Lymph
nodes are located at intervals along the
lymphatic system. Several afferent lymph
vessels bring in lymph, which percolates
through the substance of the lymph node, and
is then drained out by an efferent lymph vessel.
Of the nearly 800 lymph nodes in the human
body, about 300 are located in the head and
neck.[21] Many are grouped in clusters in
different regions, as in the underarm and
abdominal areas. Lymph node clusters are
commonly found at the proximal ends of limbs (groin, armpits)
and in the neck, where lymph is collected from regions of the
body likely to sustain pathogen contamination from injuries.
Lymph nodes are particularly numerous in the mediastinum in
the chest, neck, pelvis, axilla, inguinal region, and in association
with the blood vessels of the intestines.[8]
The substance of a lymph node consists of lymphoid follicles in
an outer portion called the cortex. The inner portion of the node
is called the medulla, which is surrounded by the cortex on all
sides except for a portion known as the hilum. The hilum
presents as a depression on the surface of the lymph node,
causing the otherwise spherical lymph node to be bean-shaped
or ovoid. The efferent lymph vessel directly emerges from the
lymph node at the hilum. The arteries and veins supplying the
lymph node with blood enter and exit through the hilum. The
region of the lymph node called the paracortex immediately
surrounds the medulla. Unlike the cortex, which has mostly
immature T cells, or thymocytes, the paracortex has a mixture of
immature and mature T cells. Lymphocytes enter the lymph
nodes through specialised high endothelial venules found in the paracortex.
A lymph follicle is a dense collection of lymphocytes, the number, size, and configuration of which change
in accordance with the functional state of the lymph node. For example, the follicles expand significantly
when encountering a foreign antigen. The selection of B cells, or B lymphocytes, occurs in the germinal
centre of the lymph nodes.
Secondary lymphoid tissue provides the environment for the foreign or altered native molecules (antigens)
to interact with the lymphocytes. It is exemplified by the lymph nodes, and the lymphoid follicles in tonsils,
Peyer's patches, spleen, adenoids, skin, etc. that are associated with the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
Lymph nodes
(MALT).
In the gastrointestinal wall, the appendix has mucosa resembling that of the colon, but here it is heavily
infiltrated with lymphocytes.
Tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) are abnormal lymph node-like structures that form in peripheral tissues at
sites of chronic inflammation, such as chronic infection, transplanted organs undergoing graft rejection,
some cancers, and autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases.[22] TLOs are regulated differently from
the normal process whereby lymphoid tissues are formed during ontogeny, being dependent on cytokines
and hematopoietic cells, but still drain interstitial fluid and transport lymphocytes in response to the same
chemical messengers and gradients.[23] TLOs typically contain far fewer lymphocytes, and assume an
immune role only when challenged with antigens that result in inflammation. They achieve this by
importing the lymphocytes from blood and lymph.[24] TLOs often have an active germinal center,
surrounded by a network of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs).[25]
TLOs are thought to play an important role in the immune response to cancer and to have possible
implications in immunotherapy. They have been observed in a number of cancer types such as melanoma,
non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer (reviewed in [26]) as well as glioma.[27] Patients with
TLOs in the vicinity of their tumors tend to have a better prognosis,[28][29] although the opposite is true for
certain cancers.[30] TLOs that contain an active germinal center tend to have a better prognosis than those
with TLOs without a germinal center.[28][29] The reason that these patients tend to live longer is thought to
be the immune response against the tumor, which is mediated by the TLOs. TLOs may also promote an
anti-tumor response when patients are treated with immunotherapy.[31] TLOs have been referred to in many
different ways, including as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and ectopic lymphoid structures (ELS).
When associated with colorectal cancer, they are often referred to as a Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction.[28]
Lymphoid tissue associated with the lymphatic system is concerned with immune functions in defending the
body against infections and the spread of tumours. It consists of connective tissue formed of reticular fibers,
with various types of leukocytes (white blood cells), mostly lymphocytes enmeshed in it, through which the
lymph passes.[32] Regions of the lymphoid tissue that are densely packed with lymphocytes are known as
lymphoid follicles. Lymphoid tissue can either be structurally well organized as lymph nodes or may consist
of loosely organized lymphoid follicles known as the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).
The central nervous system also has lymphatic vessels. The search for T cell gateways into and out of the
meninges uncovered functional meningeal lymphatic vessels lining the dural sinuses, anatomically
integrated into the membrane surrounding the brain.[33]
The lymphatic vessels, also called lymph vessels, are thin-walled vessels that conduct lymph between
different parts of the body.[34] They include the tubular vessels of the lymph capillaries, and the larger
collecting vessels – the right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct (the left lymphatic duct). The lymph

Lymphatic vessels
Lymph capillaries in the tissue spaces
capillaries are mainly responsible for the absorption of
interstitial fluid from the tissues, while lymph vessels
propel the absorbed fluid forward into the larger collecting
ducts, where it ultimately returns to the bloodstream via
one of the subclavian veins.
The tissues of the lymphatic system are responsible for
maintaining the balance of the body fluids. Its network of
capillaries and collecting lymphatic vessels work to
efficiently drain and transport extravasated fluid, along
with proteins and antigens, back to the circulatory system.
Numerous intraluminal valves in the vessels ensure a
unidirectional flow of lymph without reflux.[35] Two valve systems, a primary and a secondary valve
system, are used to achieve this unidirectional flow.[36] The capillaries are blind-ended, and the valves at the
ends of capillaries use specialised junctions together with anchoring filaments to allow a unidirectional flow
to the primary vessels. When interstitial fluid increases, it causes swelling that stretches collagen fibers
anchored to adjacent connective tissue, in turn opening the unidirectional valves at the ends of these
capillaries, facilitating the entry and subsequent drainage of excess lymph fluid. The collecting lymphatics,
however, act to propel the lymph by the combined actions of the intraluminal valves and lymphatic muscle
cells.[37]
Lymphatic tissues begin to develop by the end of the fifth week of embryonic development.
Lymphatic vessels develop from lymph sacs that arise from developing veins, which are derived from
mesoderm.
The first lymph sacs to appear are the paired jugular lymph sacs at the junction of the internal jugular and
subclavian veins.
From the jugular lymph sacs, lymphatic capillary plexuses spread to the thorax, upper limbs, neck, and
head.
Some of the plexuses enlarge and form lymphatic vessels in their respective regions. Each jugular lymph
sac retains at least one connection with its jugular vein, the left one developing into the superior portion of
the thoracic duct.
The spleen develops from mesenchymal cells between layers of the dorsal mesentery of the stomach.
The thymus arises as an outgrowth of the third pharyngeal pouch.
The lymphatic system has multiple interrelated functions:[38][39][40][41][42][43][44]
It is responsible for the removal of interstitial fluid from tissues
It absorbs and transports fatty acids and fats as chyle from the digestive system
Development
Function
Nutrients in food are absorbed via intestinal vili
(greatly enlarged in the picture) to blood and
lymph. Long-chain fatty acids (and other lipids
with similar fat solubility like some medicines)
are absorbed to the lymph and move in it
enveloped inside chylomicrons. They move via
the thoracic duct of the lymphatic system and
finally enter the blood via the left subclavian
vein, thus bypassing the liver's first-pass
metabolism completely.
It transports white blood cells to and from the lymph nodes into the bones
The lymph transports antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, to the lymph nodes
where an immune response is stimulated.
Lymph vessels called lacteals are at the beginning of the
gastrointestinal tract, predominantly in the small intestine.
While most other nutrients absorbed by the small intestine
are passed on to the portal venous system to drain via the
portal vein into the liver for processing, fats (lipids) are
passed on to the lymphatic system to be transported to the
blood circulation via the thoracic duct. (There are
exceptions, for example medium-chain triglycerides are
fatty acid esters of glycerol that passively diffuse from the
GI tract to the portal system.) The enriched lymph
originating in the lymphatics of the small intestine is called
chyle. The nutrients that are released into the circulatory
system are processed by the liver, having passed through
the systemic circulation.
The lymphatic system plays a major role in the body's
immune system, as the primary site for cells relating to
adaptive immune system including T-cells and B-cells.
Cells in the lymphatic system react to antigens presented
or found by the cells directly or by other dendritic cells.
When an antigen is recognized, an immunological cascade begins involving the activation and recruitment
of more and more cells, the production of antibodies and cytokines and the recruitment of other
immunological cells such as macrophages.
The study of lymphatic drainage of various organs is important in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of
cancer. The lymphatic system, because of its closeness to many tissues of the body, is responsible for
carrying cancerous cells between the various parts of the body in a process called metastasis. The
intervening lymph nodes can trap the cancer cells. If they are not successful in destroying the cancer cells
the nodes may become sites of secondary tumours.
Lymphadenopathy refers to one or more enlarged lymph nodes. Small groups or individually enlarged
lymph nodes are generally reactive in response to infection or inflammation. This is called local
lymphadenopathy. When many lymph nodes in different areas of the body are involved, this is called
generalised lymphadenopathy. Generalised lymphadenopathy may be caused by infections such as

infectious mononucleosis, tuberculosis and HIV, connective tissue diseases such as SLE and rheumatoid

Lymphedema is the swelling caused by the accumulation of lymph, which may occur if the lymphatic
system is damaged or has malformations. It usually affects limbs, though the face, neck and abdomen may
also be affected. In an extreme state, called elephantiasis, the edema progresses to the extent that the skin
becomes thick with an appearance similar to the skin on elephant limbs.[46]
Causes are unknown in most cases, but sometimes there is a previous history of severe infection, usually
caused by a parasitic disease, such as lymphatic filariasis.
Lymphangiomatosis is a disease involving multiple cysts or lesions formed from lymphatic vessels.
Lymphedema can also occur after surgical removal of lymph nodes in the armpit (causing the arm to swell
due to poor lymphatic drainage) or groin (causing swelling of the leg). Conventional treatment is by manual
lymphatic drainage and compression garments. Two drugs for the treatment of lymphedema are in clinical
trials: Lymfactin[47] and Ubenimex/Bestatin. There is no evidence to suggest that the effects of manual
lymphatic drainage are permanent.[48]
Cancer of the lymphatic system can be primary or secondary.
Lymphoma refers to cancer that arises from lymphatic tissue.
Lymphoid leukaemias and lymphomas are now considered to be
tumours of the same type of cell lineage. They are called
"leukaemia" when in the blood or marrow and "lymphoma" when
in lymphatic tissue. They are grouped together under the name
"lymphoid malignancy".[49]
Lymphoma is generally considered as either Hodgkin lymphoma or
non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma is characterised by a
particular type of cell, called a Reed–Sternberg cell, visible under microscope. It is associated with past
infection with the Epstein–Barr virus, and generally causes a painless "rubbery" lymphadenopathy. It is
staged, using Ann Arbor staging. Chemotherapy generally involves the ABVD and may also involve
radiotherapy.[45] Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer characterised by increased proliferation of B-cells or
T-cells, generally occurs in an older age group than Hodgkin lymphoma. It is treated according to whether it
is high-grade or low-grade, and carries a poorer prognosis than Hodgkin lymphoma.[45]
Lymphangiosarcoma is a malignant soft tissue tumour, whereas lymphangioma is a benign tumour
occurring frequently in association with Turner syndrome. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a benign tumour
of the smooth muscles of the lymphatics that occurs in the lungs.

Hippocrates, in the 5th century BC, was one of the first people to mention the lymphatic system. In his
work On Joints, he briefly mentioned the lymph nodes in one sentence. Rufus of Ephesus, a Roman
physician, identified the axillary, inguinal and mesenteric lymph nodes as well as the thymus during the 1st
to 2nd century AD.[50] The first mention of lymphatic vessels was in the 3rd century BC by Herophilos, a
Greek anatomist living in Alexandria, who incorrectly concluded that the "absorptive veins of the
lymphatics," by which he meant the lacteals (lymph vessels of the intestines), drained into the hepatic portal
veins, and thus into the liver.[50] The findings of Ruphus and Herophilos were further propagated by the
Greek physician Galen, who described the lacteals and mesenteric lymph nodes which he observed in his
dissection of apes and pigs in the 2nd century AD.[50]
In the mid 16th century, Gabriele Falloppio (discoverer of the fallopian tubes), described what is now
known as the lacteals as "coursing over the intestines full of yellow matter."[50] In about 1563 Bartolomeo
Eustachi, a professor of anatomy, described the thoracic duct in horses as vena alba thoracis.[50] The next
breakthrough came when in 1622 a physician, Gaspare Aselli, identified lymphatic vessels of the intestines
in dogs and termed them venae albae et lacteae, which are now known as simply the lacteals. The lacteals
were termed the fourth kind of vessels (the other three being the artery, vein and nerve, which was then
believed to be a type of vessel), and disproved Galen's assertion that chyle was carried by the veins. But, he
still believed that the lacteals carried the chyle to the liver (as taught by Galen).[51] He also identified the
thoracic duct but failed to notice its connection with the lacteals.[50] This connection was established by
Jean Pecquet in 1651, who found a white fluid mixing with blood in a dog's heart. He suspected that fluid
to be chyle as its flow increased when abdominal pressure was applied. He traced this fluid to the thoracic
duct, which he then followed to a chyle-filled sac he called the chyli receptaculum, which is now known as
the cisternae chyli; further investigations led him to find that lacteals' contents enter the venous system via
the thoracic duct.[50][51] Thus, it was proven convincingly that the lacteals did not terminate in the liver,
thus disproving Galen's second idea: that the chyle flowed to the liver.[51] Johann Veslingius drew the
earliest sketches of the lacteals in humans in 1641.[52]
The idea that blood recirculates through the body rather than being produced anew by the liver and the
heart was first accepted as a result of works of William Harvey—a work he published in 1628. In 1652,
Olaus Rudbeck (1630–1702) discovered certain transparent vessels in the liver that contained clear fluid
(and not white), and thus named them hepatico-aqueous vessels. He also learned that they emptied into the
thoracic duct and that they had valves.[51] He announced his findings in the court of Queen Christina of
Sweden, but did not publish his findings for a year,[53] and in the interim similar findings were published by
Thomas Bartholin, who additionally published that such vessels are present everywhere in the body, not just
Other
History
in the liver. He is also the one to have named them "lymphatic vessels."[51] This had resulted in a bitter
dispute between one of Bartholin's pupils, Martin Bogdan,[54] and Rudbeck, whom he accused of
plagiarism.[53]
Galen's ideas prevailed in medicine until the 17th century. It was thought that blood was produced by the
liver from chyle contaminated with ailments by the intestine and stomach, to which various spirits were
added by other organs, and that this blood was consumed by all the organs of the body. This theory
required that the blood be consumed and produced many times over. Even in the 17th century, his ideas
were defended by some physicians.[55][56][57]
Alexander Monro, of the University of Edinburgh Medical School, was the first to describe the function of
the lymphatic system in detail.[58]

Lymph originates in the Classical Latin word lympha "water",[59] which is also the source of the English
word limpid. The spelling with y and ph was influenced by folk etymology with Greek νύμϕη (nýmphē)
"nymph".[60]
Etymology
The adjective used for the lymph-transporting system is lymphatic. The adjective used for the tissues where
lymphocytes are formed is lymphoid. Lymphatic comes from the Latin word lymphaticus, meaning
"connected to water."

These structures express all of the molecular hallmarks of lymphatic endothelial cells, are
able to carry both fluid and immune cells from the cerebrospinal fluid, and are connected to
the deep cervical lymph nodes. The unique location of these vessels may have impeded
their discovery to date, thereby contributing to the long-held concept of the absence of
lymphatic vasculature in the central nervous system. The discovery of the central nervous
system lymphatic system may call for a reassessment of basic assumptions in
neuroimmunology and sheds new light on the aetiology of neuroinflammatory and
neurodegenerative diseases associated with immune system dysfunction."
