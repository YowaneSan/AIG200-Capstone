Anatomical terminology
Human reproductive system
The human reproductive system includes the male
reproductive system, which functions to produce and deposit
sperm, and the female reproductive system, which functions to
produce egg cells and to protect and nourish the fetus until
birth. Humans have a high level of sexual differentiation. In
addition to differences in nearly every reproductive organ, there
are 
numerous 
differences 
in 
typical 
secondary 
sex
characteristics.
Human reproduction usually involves internal fertilization by
sexual intercourse. In this process, the male inserts his penis
into the female's vagina and ejaculates semen, which contains
sperm. A small proportion of the sperm pass through the cervix
into the uterus and then into the fallopian tubes for fertilization
of the ovum. Only one sperm is required to fertilize the ovum.
Upon successful fertilization, the fertilized ovum, or zygote,
travels out of the fallopian tube and into the uterus, where it
implants in the uterine wall. This marks the beginning of
gestation, better known as pregnancy, which continues for
around nine months as the fetus develops. When the fetus has
developed to a certain point, pregnancy is concluded with
childbirth, involving labor. During labor, the uterine muscles
contract, and the cervix dilates typically over a period of hours,
allowing the infant to pass from the uterus through the
vagina.[1] Human infants are entirely dependent on their
caregivers and require parental care. Infants rely on their
caregivers for comfort, cleanliness, and food. Food may be
provided by breastfeeding or formula feeding.[2]
The human female reproductive system is a series of organs
primarily located inside the body and around the pelvic region
of a female that contribute towards the reproductive process.
The human female reproductive system contains three main
parts: the vagina, which leads from the vulva, the vaginal
opening, to the uterus; the uterus, which holds the developing fetus; and the ovaries, which produce the
female's ova. The breasts are involved during the parenting stage of reproduction, but in most classifications
they are not considered to be part of the female reproductive system.[3]

Penile shrinkage due to low
temperatures. The scrotum is in a
tense state to regulate testicular
temperatures.
The vagina meets the outside at the vulva, which is made up of the
labia, clitoris and urethra;[4] during intercourse this area is lubricated
by mucus secreted by the Bartholin's glands. The vagina is attached
to the uterus through the cervix, while the uterus is attached to the
ovaries via the fallopian tubes. Each ovary contains hundreds of
egg cells or ova (singular ovum).
Approximately every 28 days, the pituitary gland releases a
hormone that stimulates some of the ova to develop and grow. One
ovum is released and it passes through the fallopian tube into the
uterus. Hormones produced by the ovaries prepare the uterus to
receive the ovum. The lining of the uterus, called the endometrium,
and unfertilized ova are shed each cycle through the process of
menstruation. If the ova is fertilized by sperm, it attaches to the
endometrium and the fetus develops.[3]
The male reproductive system is a series of organs located outside
the body and around the pelvis region of a male that contribute
towards the reproduction process. The primary direct function of
the male reproductive system is to provide the male sperm for
fertilization of the ovum.[3]
The major reproductive organs of the male can be grouped into
three categories. The first category produces and stores sperm
(spermatozoa). These are produced in the testicles, which are
housed in the temperature-regulating scrotum; immature sperm then
travel to the epididymides for development and storage. The second
category are the ejaculatory fluid producing glands which include
the Cowper's gland (also called bulbourethral gland), seminal
vesicles, prostate, and vas deferens. The final category are those
used for copulation and deposition of the sperm within the female;
these include the penis, urethra, and vas deferens.[3]
Major secondary sexual characteristics include a larger, more
muscular stature, deepened voice, facial and body hair, broad
shoulders, and the development of an Adam's apple.[5] An
important sexual hormone of males is androgen, particularly
testosterone.[6]
The testes release a hormone that controls the development of
sperm. This hormone is also responsible for the development of
physical characteristics in men, such as facial hair and a deep voice.
Male
Development
Anatomy of the testis
The development of the reproductive system and the development of the urinary system are closely tied to
the development of the human fetus. Despite the differences between them, the adult male and female are
determined in early development in the 6th week. The gonads and external genitals are derived from the
intermediate mesoderm.[7] The three main fetal precursors of the reproductive organs are the Wolffian duct,
the Müllerian ducts, and the gonads. Endocrine hormones are a well-known and critical controlling factor in
the normal differentiation of the reproductive system.[8]
The Wolffian duct forms the epididymis, vas deferens, ejaculatory duct, and seminal vesicle in the male
reproductive system, but essentially disappears in the female reproductive system.[9] The reverse is true for
the Müllerian duct, as it essentially disappears in the male reproductive system and forms the fallopian
tubes, uterus, and vagina in the female system. In both sexes, the gonads go on to form the testes and
ovaries; because they are derived from the same undeveloped structure, they are considered homologous
organs. There are a number of other homologous structures shared between male and female reproductive
systems. However, despite the similarity in function of the female fallopian tubes and the male epididymis
and vas deferens, they are not homologous but rather analogous structures as they arise from different fetal
structures.
Gametes are produced within the gonads through a process known as gametogenesis. This occurs when
certain types of germ cells undergo meiosis to split the normal diploid number of chromosomes (n=46) into
haploid cells containing only 23 chromosomes.[10]
In males, this process is known as spermatogenesis and occurs only
after puberty in the seminiferous tubules of the testes. The immature
spermatozoa or sperm are then sent to the epididymis, where they
gain a tail, enabling motility. Each of the original diploid germ cells
or primary spermatocytes forms four functional gametes, each
forever young. The production and survival of sperms require a
temperature below the normal core body temperature. Since the
scrotum, where the testes is present, is situated outside the body
cavity, it provides a temperature about 3  °C below normal body
temperature.
In females, gametogenesis is known as oogenesis; this occurs in the
ovarian follicles of the ovaries. This process does not produce
mature ovum until puberty. In contrast with males, each of the
original diploid germ cells or primary oocytes will form only one mature ovum, and three polar bodies
which are not capable of fertilization. It has long been understood that in females, unlike males, all the
primary oocytes ever found in a female will be created prior to birth, and that the final stages of ova

production will then not resume until puberty.[10] However, recent scientific research has challenged that
hypothesis.[11] This new research indicates that in at least some species of mammal, oocytes continue to be
replenished in females well after birth.[12]
Like all complex organ systems, the human reproductive system is affected by many diseases. There are
four main categories of reproductive diseases in humans. They are:
Genetic or congenital abnormalities.
Cancers.
Infections, which are often sexually transmitted
infections.
Varicocele [13]
Functional problems caused by environmental factors,
physical damage, psychological issues, autoimmune
disorders, or other causes. The best-known functional
problems include sexual dysfunction and infertility, which
are both broad terms relating to many disorders with
many causes.
Specific reproductive diseases are often symptoms of other diseases
and disorders, or have multiple, or unknown causes making them difficult to classify. Examples of
unclassifiable disorders are Peyronie's disease in males and endometriosis in females. Many congenital
conditions cause reproductive abnormalities, but are better known for their other symptoms. These include:
Turner syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and Bloom syndrome.[14]
