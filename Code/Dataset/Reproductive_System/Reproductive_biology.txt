Reproductive biology
Reproductive biology includes both sexual and asexual reproduction.[1][2]
Reproductive biology includes a wide number of fields:
Reproductive systems
Endocrinology
Sexual development (Puberty)
Sexual maturity
Reproduction
Fertility
Human reproductive biology is primarily controlled through hormones, which send signals to the human
reproductive structures to influence growth and maturation. These hormones are secreted by endocrine
glands, and spread to different tissues in the human body. In humans, the pituitary gland synthesizes
hormones used to control the activity of endocrine glands.[3]
Internal and external organs are included in the reproductive system. There are two reproductive systems
including the male and female, which contain different organs from one another. These systems work
together in order to produce offspring.[4]
The female reproductive system includes the structures involved in ovulation, fertilization, development of
an embryo, and birth.[3]
These structures include:
Ovaries
Oviducts
Uterus
Vagina
Mammary Glands

Estrogen is one of the sexual reproductive hormones that aid in the
sexual reproductive system of the female.[2]
The male reproductive system includes testes, rete testis, efferent
ductules, epididymis, sex accessory glands, sex accessory ducts and
external genitalia.[3]
Testosterone, an androgen, although present in both males and
females, is relatively more abundant in males. Testosterone serves
as one of the major sexual reproductive hormones in the male
reproductive system However, the enzyme aromatase is present in
testes and capable of synthesizing estrogens from androgens.[2] Estrogens are present in high concentrations
in luminal fluids of the male reproductive tract.[5] Androgen and estrogen receptors are abundant in
epithelial cells of the male reproductive tract.[6]
Animal reproduction occurs by two modes of action, including both sexual and asexual reproduction.[1] In
asexual reproduction the generation of new organisms does not require the fusion sperm with an egg.[1]
However, in sexual reproduction new organisms are formed by the fusion of haploid sperm and eggs
resulting in what is known as the zygote.[1] Although animals exhibit both sexual and asexual reproduction
the vast majority of animals reproduce by sexual reproduction.[1]
In many species, relatively little is known about the conditions needed for successful breeding. Such
information may be critical to preventing widespread extinction as species are increasingly affected by
climate change and other threats.[7][8] In the case of some species of frogs, such as the Mallorcan midwife
toad and the Kihansi spray toad, it has been possible to repopulate areas where wild populations had been
lost.[9]
Gametogenesis is the formation of gametes, or reproductive cells.
Spermatogenesis is the production of sperm cells in the testis. In mature testes primordial germ cells divide
mitotically to form the spermatogonia, which in turn generate spermatocytes by mitosis.[10] Then each
spermatocyte gives rise to four spermatids through meiosis.[10] Spermatids are now haploid and undergo
differentiation into sperm cells.[10] Later in reproduction the sperm will fuse with a female oocyte to form
the zygote.
Oogenesis is the formation of a cell who will produce one ovum and three polar bodies.[10] Oogenesis
begins in the female embryo with the production of oogonia from primordial germ cells. Like
spermatogenesis, the primordial germ cell undergo mitotic division to form the cells that will later undergo

meiosis, but will be halted at the prophase I stage.[10] This is known as the primary oocyte. Human females
are born with all the primary oocytes they will ever have.[10] Starting at puberty the process of meiosis can
complete resulting in the secondary oocyte and the first polar body.[10] The secondary oocyte can later be
fertilized with the male sperm.
