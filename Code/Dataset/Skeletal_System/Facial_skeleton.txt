Facial skeleton
The facial skeleton comprises the facial bones that may attach
to build a portion of the skull.[1] The remainder of the skull is
the neurocranium.
In human anatomy and development, the facial skeleton is
sometimes called the membranous viscerocranium, which
comprises the mandible and dermatocranial elements that are
not part of the braincase.
In the human skull, the facial skeleton consists of fourteen
bones in the face:[1][2]
Inferior turbinal (2)
Lacrimal bones (2)
Mandible
Maxilla (2)
Nasal bones (2)
Palatine bones (2)
Vomer
Zygomatic bones (2)
Elements 
of 
the 
cartilaginous 
viscerocranium 
(i.e.,
splanchnocranial elements), such as the hyoid bone, are
sometimes considered part of the facial skeleton. The ethmoid
bone (or a part of it) and also the sphenoid bone are sometimes
included, but otherwise considered part of the neurocranium.
Because the maxillary bones are fused, they are often
collectively listed as only one bone. The mandible is generally
considered separately from the cranium.
The facial skeleton is composed of dermal bone and derived
from the neural crest cells (also responsible for the development
of the neurocranium, teeth and adrenal medulla) or from the
sclerotome, which derives from the somite block of the

mesoderm. As with the neurocranium, in Chondricthyes and
other cartilaginous vertebrates, they are not replaced via
endochondral ossification.
Variation in craniofacial form between humans is largely due to
differing patterns of biological inheritance. Cross-analysis of
osteological variables and genome-wide SNPs has identified
specific genes that control this craniofacial development. Of
these genes, DCHS2, RUNX2, GLI3, PAX1 and PAX3 were
found to determine nasal morphology, whereas EDAR impacts chin protrusion.[3]
