Skeleton in the closet
Skeleton in the closet or skeleton in the cupboard is a colloquial
phrase and idiom used to describe an undisclosed fact about
someone which, if revealed, would damage perceptions of the
person. It evokes the idea of someone having had a human corpse
concealed in their home so long that all its flesh had decomposed to
the bone. "Cupboard" may be used in British English instead of the
American English word "closet". It is known to have been used as
a phrase as early as at least November 1816.[1] It is listed in both
the Oxford English Dictionary, and Webster's Dictionary, under the
word "skeleton". The "Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary"
lists it under this but also as a separate idiom. In the most derisive of
usage, 
murder, 
or 
significant 
culpability 
in 
a 
years-old
disappearance or non-understood event (a mystery), may be implied
by the phrase.
