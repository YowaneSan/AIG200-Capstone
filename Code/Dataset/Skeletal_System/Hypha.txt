Hypha
A hypha (from Ancient Greek ὑφή (huphḗ) 'web'; pl.: hyphae) is a
long, branching, filamentous structure of a fungus, oomycete, or
actinobacterium.[1] In most fungi, hyphae are the main mode of
vegetative growth, and are collectively called a mycelium.
A hypha consists of one or more cells surrounded by a tubular cell
wall. In most fungi, hyphae are divided into cells by internal cross-
walls called "septa" (singular septum). Septa are usually perforated
by pores large enough for ribosomes, mitochondria, and sometimes
nuclei to flow between cells. The major structural polymer in fungal
cell walls is typically chitin, in contrast to plants and oomycetes that
have cellulosic cell walls. Some fungi have aseptate hyphae,
meaning their hyphae are not partitioned by septa.
Hyphae have an average diameter of 4–6 μm.[2]
Hyphae grow at their tips. During tip growth, cell walls are
extended by the external assembly and polymerization of cell wall
components, and the internal production of new cell membrane.[3]
The Spitzenkörper is an intracellular organelle associated with tip
growth. It is composed of an aggregation of membrane-bound
vesicles containing cell wall components. The Spitzenkörper is part
of the endomembrane system of fungi, holding and releasing
vesicles it receives from the Golgi apparatus. These vesicles travel
to the cell membrane via the cytoskeleton and release their contents
(including various cysteine-rich proteins including cerato-platanins
and hydrophobins)[4][5] outside the cell by the process of
exocytosis, where they can then be transported to where they are
needed. Vesicle membranes contribute to growth of the cell
membrane while their contents form new cell wall. The
Spitzenkörper moves along the apex of the hyphal strand and
generates apical growth and branching; the apical growth rate of the
hyphal strand parallels and is regulated by the movement of the Spitzenkörper.[6]

As a hypha extends, septa may be formed behind the growing tip to
partition each hypha into individual cells. Hyphae can branch
through the bifurcation of a growing tip, or by the emergence of a
new tip from an established hypha.
The direction of hyphal growth can be controlled by environmental
stimuli, such as the application of an electric field. Hyphae can also
sense reproductive units from some distance, and grow towards
them. Hyphae can weave through a permeable surface to penetrate
it.[3]
Hyphae may be modified in many different ways to serve specific
functions. Some parasitic fungi form haustoria that function in
absorption within the host cells. The arbuscules of mutualistic
mycorrhizal fungi serve a similar function in nutrient exchange, so
are important in assisting nutrient and water absorption by plants.
Ectomycorrhizal extramatrical mycelium greatly increases the soil
area available for exploitation by plant hosts by funneling water and
nutrients to ectomycorrhizas, complex fungal organs on the tips of
plant roots. Hyphae are found enveloping the gonidia in lichens,
making up a large part of their structure. In nematode-trapping
fungi, hyphae may be modified into trapping structures such as
constricting rings and adhesive nets. Mycelial cords can be formed
to transfer nutrients over larger distances. Bulk fungal tissues, cords,
and membranes, such as those of mushrooms and lichens, are
mainly composed of felted and often anastomosed hyphae.[7]
Septate (with septa)
Aspergillus[8] and many other species have septate hyphae.
Aseptate (non-septate) or coenocytic (without septa)
Non-septate hyphae are associated with Mucor,[9] some zygomycetes, and other fungi.
Pseudohyphae are distinguished from true hyphae by their method of growth, relative frailty
and lack of cytoplasmic connection between the cells.

Types
Classification based on cell division
Yeasts form pseudohyphae.[10] They are the result of a sort of incomplete budding where
the cells elongate but remain attached after division. Some yeasts can also form true
septate hyphae.[11]
Characteristics of hyphae can be important in fungal classification. In basidiomycete taxonomy, hyphae that
comprise the fruiting body can be identified as generative, skeletal, or binding hyphae.[12]
Generative hyphae are relatively undifferentiated and can develop reproductive structures.
They are typically thin-walled, occasionally developing slightly thickened walls, usually have
frequent septa, and may or may not have clamp connections. They may be embedded in
mucilage or gelatinized materials.
Skeletal hyphae are of two basic types. The classical form is thick-walled and very long in
comparison to the frequently septate generative hyphae, which are unbranched or rarely
branched, with little cell content. They have few septa and lack clamp connections. Fusiform
skeletal hyphae are the second form of skeletal hyphae. Unlike typical skeletal hyphae these
are swollen centrally and often exceedingly broad, hence giving the hypha a fusiform shape.
Binding hyphae are thick-walled and frequent branched. Often they resemble deer antlers or
defoliated trees because of the many tapering branches.
Based on the generative, skeletal and binding hyphal types, in 1932 E. J. H. Corner applied the terms
monomitic, dimitic, and trimitic to hyphal systems, in order to improve the classification of
polypores.[13][14]
Every fungus must contain generative hyphae. A fungus which only contains this type, as do
fleshy mushrooms such as agarics, is referred to as monomitic.
If a fungus contains the obligate generative hyphae (as mentioned in the last point, "every
fungus must contain generative hyphae") and just one of the other two types (either skeletal
or binding hyphae), it is called dimitic. In fact dimitic fungi almost always contain generative
and skeletal hyphae; there is one exceptional genus, Laetiporus that includes only
generative and binding hyphae.
Skeletal and binding hyphae give leathery and woody fungi such as polypores their tough
consistency. If a fungus contains all three types (example: Trametes), it is called trimitic.
Fungi that form fusiform skeletal hyphae bound by generative hyphae are said to have sarcodimitic hyphal
systems. A few fungi form fusiform skeletal hyphae, generative hyphae, and binding hyphae, and these are
said to have sarcotrimitic hyphal systems. These terms were introduced as a later refinement by E. J. H.
Corner in 1966.[15]
Hyphae are described as "gloeoplerous" ("gloeohyphae") if their high refractive index gives them an oily or
granular appearance under the microscope. These cells may be yellowish or clear (hyaline). They can
sometimes selectively be coloured by sulphovanillin or other reagents. The specialized cells termed cystidia
can also be gloeoplerous.[16][17]
Classification based on cell wall and overall form
Classification based on refractive appearance
Classification based on growth location
Hyphae might be categorized as 'vegetative' or 'aerial.' Aerial hyphae of fungi produce asexual reproductive
spores.[18]
