Anatomical terminology
Bronchiole
The bronchioles or bronchioli (pronounced bron-kee-oh-lee)
are the smaller branches of the bronchial airways in the lower
respiratory tract. They include the terminal bronchioles, and
finally the respiratory bronchioles that mark the start of the
respiratory zone delivering air to the gas exchanging units of
the alveoli. The bronchioles no longer contain the cartilage that
is found in the bronchi, or glands in their submucosa.[1]
The pulmonary lobule is the portion of the lung ventilated by
one bronchiole. Bronchioles are approximately 1 mm or less in
diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium
and a layer of smooth muscle. Bronchioles divide into even
smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5 mm or less
in diameter. Terminal bronchioles in turn divide into smaller
respiratory bronchioles which divide into alveolar ducts.
Terminal bronchioles mark the end of the conducting division
of air flow in the respiratory system while respiratory
bronchioles are the beginning of the respiratory division where
gas exchange takes place.
The diameter of the bronchioles plays an important role in air
flow. The bronchioles change diameter to either increase or
reduce air flow. An increase in diameter is called
bronchodilation and is stimulated by either epinephrine or
sympathetic nerves to increase air flow. A decrease in diameter
is called bronchoconstriction, which is the tightening of the
smooth muscle surrounding the bronchi and bronchioles due to
and stimulated by histamine, parasympathetic nerves, cold air,
chemical irritants, excess mucus production, viral infections,
and other factors to decrease air flow. Bronchoconstriction can
result in clinical symptoms such as wheezing, chest tightness,
and dyspnea, which are common features of asthma, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic bronchitis.
[2]
The trachea divides into the left main bronchus which supplies
the left lung, and the right main bronchus which supplies the right lung. As they enter the lungs these
primary bronchi branch into secondary bronchi known as lobar bronchi which supply each lobe of the lung.
Structure
Bronchioles
A lobule of the lung enclosed in
septa and supplied by a terminal
bronchiole that branches into the
respiratory bronchioles. Each
respiratory bronchiole supplies the
alveoli held in each acinus
accompanied by a pulmonary artery
branch.
Lungs showing bronchi and bronchioles
These in turn give rise to tertiary bronchi (tertiary meaning "third"),
known as segmental bronchi which supply each bronchopulmonary
segment.[1] The segmentary bronchi subdivide into fourth order,
fifth order and sixth order segmental bronchi before dividing into
the bronchioles. The bronchioles are histologically distinct from the
bronchi in that their walls do not have hyaline cartilage and they
have club cells in their epithelial lining. The epithelium of the
bronchioles starts as a simple ciliated columnar epithelium and
changes to simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium as the bronchioles
decreases in size. The diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be
less than 1 mm, though this value can range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm.
As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to
maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to
the surrounding lung tissue for support. The inner lining (lamina
propria) of these bronchioles is thin with no glands present, and is
surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle. As the bronchioles get
smaller they divide into terminal bronchioles. Each bronchiole
divides into between 50 and 80 terminal bronchioles.[3] These
bronchioles mark the end of the conducting zone, which covers the
first division through the sixteenth division of the
respiratory tract. Alveoli only become present
when the conducting zone changes to the
respiratory zone, from the sixteenth through the
twenty-third division of the tract.
The terminal bronchioles are the most distal
segment of the conducting zone. They branch
off the lesser bronchioles. Each of the terminal
bronchioles 
divides 
to 
form 
respiratory
bronchioles which contain a small number of
alveoli. Terminal bronchioles are lined with
simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium containing club cells. Club cells are non-ciliated, rounded protein-
secreting cells. Their secretions are a non-sticky, proteinaceous compound to maintain the airway in the
smallest bronchioles. The secretion, called pulmonary surfactant, reduces surface tension, allowing for
bronchioles to expand during inspiration and keeping the bronchioles from collapsing during expiration.
Club cells are a stem cell of the respiratory system, and also produce enzymes that detoxify substances
dissolved in the respiratory fluid.
Terminal bronchioles
Respiratory bronchioles
The respiratory bronchioles are the narrowest airways of the lungs, 0.5 mm across.[4] The bronchi divide
many times before evolving into the bronchioles. The respiratory bronchioles deliver air to the exchange
surfaces of the lungs.[5] They are interrupted by alveoli which are thin walled evaginations. Alveolar ducts
are side branches of the respiratory bronchioles. The respiratory bronchioles are lined by ciliated columnar
epithelium along with some non-ciliated cells called club cells.[6]
Bronchospasm, a potentially life-threatening situation, occurs when the smooth muscular tissue of the
bronchioles constricts, severely narrowing their diameter. The most common cause of this is asthma.
Bronchospasm is commonly treated by oxygen therapy and bronchodilators such as albuterol.
Diseases of the bronchioles include asthma, bronchiolitis obliterans, respiratory syncytial virus infections,
and influenza.
The medical condition of inflammation of the bronchioles is termed bronchiolitis.[7]
