Pleural cavity
The pleural cavity, pleural space, or intrapleural space is the potential space between the pleurae of the
pleural sac that surrounds each lung. A small amount of serous pleural fluid is maintained in the pleural
cavity to enable lubrication between the membranes, and also to create a pressure gradient.[1]
The serous membrane that covers the surface of the lung is the visceral pleura and is separated from the
outer membrane, the parietal pleura, by just the film of pleural fluid in the pleural cavity. The visceral pleura
follows the fissures of the lung and the root of the lung structures. The parietal pleura is attached to the
mediastinum, the upper surface of the diaphragm, and to the inside of the ribcage.[1]
In humans, the left and right lungs are completely separated by the mediastinum, and there is no
communication between their pleural cavities. Therefore, in cases of a unilateral pneumothorax, the
contralateral lung will remain functioning normally unless there is a tension pneumothorax, which may shift
the mediastinum and the trachea, kink the great vessels and eventually collapse the contralateral
cardiopulmonary circulation.
The visceral pleura receives its blood supply from the parenchymal capillaries of the underlying lung, which
have input from both the pulmonary and the bronchial circulation. The parietal pleura receives its blood
supply from whatever structures underlying it, which can be branched from the aorta (intercostal, superior
phrenic and inferior phrenic arteries), the internal thoracic (pericardiacophrenic, anterior intercostal and
musculophrenic branches), or their anastomosis.
The visceral pleurae are innervated by splanchnic nerves from the pulmonary plexus, which also innervates
the lungs and bronchi. The parietal pleurae however, like their blood supplies, receive nerve supplies from
different sources. The costal pleurae (including the portion that bulges above the thoracic inlet) and the
periphery of the diaphragmatic pleurae are innervated by the intercostal nerves from the enclosing rib cage,
which branches off from the T1-T12 thoracic spinal cord. The mediastinal pleurae and central portions of
the diaphragmatic pleurae are innervated by the phrenic nerves. which branches off the C3-C5 cervcial
cord. Only the parietal pleurae contain somatosensory nerves and are capable of perceiving pain.
During the third week of embryogenesis, each lateral mesoderm splits into two layers. The dorsal layer joins
the overlying somites and ectoderm to form the somatopleure; and the ventral layer joins the underlying
endoderm to form the splanchnopleure.[2] The dehiscence of these two layers creates a fluid-filled cavity on
each side, and with the ventral infolding and the subsequent midline fusion of the trilaminar disc, forms a
pair of intraembryonic coeloms anterolaterally around the gut tube during the fourth week, with the
splanchnopleure on the inner cavity wall and the somatopleure on the outer cavity wall.
The cranial end of the intraembryonic coeloms fuse early to form a single cavity, which rotates invertedly
and apparently descends in front of the thorax, and is later encroached by the growing primordial heart as
the pericardial cavity. The caudal portions of the coeloms fuse later below the umbilical vein to become the

Anatomical terminology
larger peritoneal cavity, separated from the pericardial cavity by
the transverse septum. The two cavities communicate via a slim
pair of remnant coeloms adjacent to the upper foregut called the
pericardioperitoneal canal. During the fifth week, the
developing lung buds begin to invaginate into these canals,
creating a pair of enlarging cavities that encroach into the
surrounding somites and further displace the transverse septum
caudally — namely the pleural cavities. The mesothelia pushed
out by the developing lungs arise from the splanchnopleure,
and become the visceral pleurae; while the other mesothelial
surfaces of the pleural cavities arise from the somatopleure, and
become the parietal pleurae.
The tissue separating the newly formed pleural cavities from the
pericardial cavity are known as the pericardiopleural
membranes, which later become the side walls of the fibrous
pericardium. The transverse septum and the displaced somites
fuse to form the pleuroperitoneal membranes, which separates
the pleural cavities from the peritoneal cavity and later becomes
the diaphragm.
The pleural cavity, with its associated pleurae, aids optimal
functioning of the lungs during breathing. The pleural cavity
also contains pleural fluid, which acts as a lubricant and allows
the pleurae to slide effortlessly against each other during
respiratory movements.[3] Surface tension of the pleural fluid
also leads to close apposition of the lung surfaces with the chest
wall. This relationship allows for greater inflation of the alveoli
during breathing. The pleural cavity transmits movements of the
ribs muscles to the lungs, particularly during heavy breathing.
During inhalation the external intercostals contract, as does the
diaphragm. This causes the expansion of the chest wall, that
increases the volume of the lungs. A negative pressure is thus
created and inhalation occurs.
Pleural fluid is a serous fluid produced by the serous membrane
covering normal pleurae. Most fluid is produced by the
exudation in parietal circulation (intercostal arteries) via bulk
flow and reabsorbed by the lymphatic system.[4] Thus, pleural
fluid is produced and reabsorbed continuously. The composition and volume is regulated by mesothelial
cells in the pleura.[5] In a normal 70 kg human, a few milliliters of pleural fluid is always present within the
intrapleural space.[6] Larger quantities of fluid can accumulate in the pleural space only when the rate of
production exceeds the rate of reabsorption. Normally, the rate of reabsorption increases as a physiological

response to accumulating fluid, with the reabsorption rate increasing up to 40 times the normal rate before
significant amounts of fluid accumulate within the pleural space. Thus, a profound increase in the
production of pleural fluid—or some blocking of the reabsorbing lymphatic system—is required for fluid to
accumulate in the pleural space.
The hydrostatic equilibrium model, viscous flow model and capillary equilibrium model are the three
hypothesised models of circulation of pleural fluid.[7]
According to the viscous flow model, the intra pleural pressure gradient drives a downward viscous flow of
pleural fluid along the flat surfaces of ribs.The capillary equilibrium model states that the high negative
apical pleural pressure leads to a basal-to-apical gradient at the mediastinal pleural surface, leading to a fluid
flow directed up towards the apex (helped by the beating heart and ventilation in lungs).Thus the
recirculation of fluid occurs. Finally there's a traverse flow from margins to flat portion of ribs completes the
fluid circulation.[8][9]
Absorption occurs into lymphatic vessels at the level of the diaphragmatic pleura.[10]
A pathologic collection of pleural fluid is called a pleural effusion.
Mechanisms:
1. Lymphatic obstruction
2. Increased capillary permeability
3. Decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure
4. Increased capillary venous pressure
5. Increased negative intrapleural pressure
Pleural effusions are classified as exudative (high protein) or
transudative (low protein). Exudative pleural effusions are generally
caused by infections such as pneumonia (parapneumonic pleural
effusion), malignancy, granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis
or coccidioidomycosis, collagen vascular diseases, and other
inflammatory states. Transudative pleural effusions occur in congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis or
nephrotic syndrome.
Localized pleural fluid effusion noted during pulmonary embolism (PE) results probably from increased
capillary permeability due to cytokine or inflammatory mediator release from the platelet-rich thrombi.[11]

When accumulation of pleural fluid is noted, cytopathologic evaluation of the fluid, as well as clinical
microscopy, microbiology, chemical studies, tumor markers, pH determination and other more esoteric tests
are required as diagnostic tools for determining the causes of this abnormal accumulation. Even the gross
appearance, color, clarity and odor can be useful tools in diagnosis. The presence of heart failure, infection
or malignancy within the pleural cavity are the most common causes that can be identified using this
approach.[13]
Clear straw-colored: If transudative, no further analysis needed. If exudative, additional
studies needed to determine cause (cytology, culture, biopsy).
Cloudy, purulent, turbid: Infection, empyema, pancreatitis, malignancy.
Pink to red/bloody: Traumatic tap, malignancy, pulmonary infarction, intestinal infarction,
pancreatitis, trauma.
Green-white, turbid: Rheumatoid arthritis with pleural effusion.
Green-brown: Biliary disease, bowel perforation with ascites.
Milky-white or yellow and bloody: Chylous effusion.
Milky or green, metallic sheen: Pseudochylous effusion.
Viscous (hemorrhagic or clear): Mesothelioma.
Anchovy-paste (or 'chocolate sauce'): Ruptured amoebic liver abscess.[12]
Microscopy may show resident cells (mesothelial cells, inflammatory cells) of either benign or malignant
etiology. Evaluation by a cytopathologist is then performed and a morphologic diagnosis can be made.
Neutrophils are numerous in pleural empyema. If lymphocytes predominate and mesothelial cells are rare,
this is suggestive of tuberculosis. Mesothelial cells may also be decreased in cases of rheumatoid pleuritis or
post-pleurodesis pleuritis. Eosinophils are often seen if a patient has recently undergone prior pleural fluid
tap. Their significance is limited.[14]

If malignant cells are present, a pathologist may perform additional studies including immunohistochemistry
to determine the etiology of the malignancy.
Chemistry studies may be performed including pH, pleural fluid:serum protein ratio, LDH ratio, specific
gravity, cholesterol and bilirubin levels. These studies may help clarify the etiology of a pleural effusion
(exudative vs transudative). Amylase may be elevated in pleural effusions related to gastric/esophageal
perforations, pancreatitis or malignancy. Pleural effusions are classified as exudative (high protein) or
transudative (low protein).
In spite of all the diagnostic tests available today, many pleural effusions remain idiopathic in origin. If
severe symptoms persist, more invasive techniques may be required. In spite of the lack of knowledge of
the cause of the effusion, treatment may be required to relieve the most common symptom, dyspnea, as this
can be quite disabling. Thoracoscopy has become the mainstay of invasive procedures as closed pleural
biopsy has fallen into disuse.
Diseases of the pleural cavity include:
Pneumothorax: a collection of air within the pleural cavity
Pleural effusion: a fluid accumulation within the pleural space.
Pleural tumors: abnormal growths on the pleurae.
