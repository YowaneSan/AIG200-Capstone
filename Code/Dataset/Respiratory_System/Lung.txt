Lung
The lungs are the central organs of the respiratory system in
humans and most other animals, including some snails and a
small number of fish. In mammals and most other vertebrates,
two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the
heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract
oxygen from the air and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to
release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the
atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. The pleurae, which
are thin, smooth, and moist, serve to reduce friction between the
lungs and chest wall during breathing, allowing for easy and
effortless movements of the lungs.
Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different
species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles
to support and foster breathing. In earlier tetrapods, air was
driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal
pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the
main muscle of respiration that drives breathing is the
diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal
sounds including human speech possible.
Humans have two lungs, one on the left and one on the right.
They are situated within the thoracic cavity of the chest. The
right lung is bigger and heavier than the left, which shares
space in the chest with the heart. The lungs together weigh
approximately 1.3 kilograms (2.9 pounds). The lungs are part
of the lower respiratory tract that begins at the trachea and
branches into the bronchi and bronchioles, and which receive
air breathed in via the conducting zone. The conducting zone
ends at the terminal bronchioles. These divide into the
respiratory bronchioles of the respiratory zone which divide
into alveolar ducts that give rise to the alveolar sacs that contain
the alveoli, where gas exchange takes place. Alveoli are also
sparsely present on the walls of the respiratory bronchioles and
alveolar ducts. Together, the lungs contain approximately 2,400
kilometres (1,500 miles) of airways and 300 to 500 million
alveoli. Each lung is enclosed within a pleural sac of two
membranes called pleurae; the membranes are separated by a
film of pleural fluid, which allows the inner and outer
membranes to slide over each other whilst breathing takes
place, without much friction. The inner pleura also divides each

lung into sections called lobes. The right lung has three lobes
and the left has two. The lobes are further divided into
bronchopulmonary segments and pulmonary lobules. The lungs
have a unique blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood
from the heart in the pulmonary circulation for the purposes of
receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate
supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the
bronchial circulation. Deoxygenated blood travels from the
heart through the pulmonary artery to the lungs to be
oxygenated in capillaries of alveoli. After the blood is
oxygenated, it returns to the heart through the pulmonary vein
to be sent to the rest of the body.[1][2]  
The tissue of the lungs can be affected by a number of respiratory diseases, including pneumonia and lung
cancer. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and can be
related to smoking or exposure to harmful substances. A number of occupational lung diseases can be
caused by substances such as coal dust, asbestos fibres, and crystalline silica dust. Diseases such as
bronchitis can also affect the respiratory tract. Medical terms related to the lung often begin with pulmo-,
from the Latin pulmonarius (of the lungs) as in pulmonology, or with pneumo- (from Greek πνεύμων
"lung") as in pneumonia.
In embryonic development, the lungs begin to develop as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes
on to form the upper part of the digestive system. When the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-
filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the
ductus arteriosus. At birth, however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes,
so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.
The lungs are located in the chest on either side of
the heart in the rib cage. They are conical in shape
with a narrow rounded apex at the top, and a
broad concave base that rests on the convex
surface of the diaphragm.[3] The apex of the lung
extends into the root of the neck, reaching shortly
above the level of the sternal end of the first rib.
The lungs stretch from close to the backbone in
the rib cage to the front of the chest and
downwards from the lower part of the trachea to
the diaphragm.[3]
The left lung shares space with the heart, and has an indentation in its border called the cardiac notch of
the left lung to accommodate this.[4][5] The front and outer sides of the lungs face the ribs, which make
light indentations on their surfaces. The medial surfaces of the lungs face towards the centre of the chest,

and lie against the heart, great vessels, and the carina where the trachea divides into the two main
bronchi.[5] The cardiac impression is an indentation formed on the surfaces of the lungs where they rest
against the heart.
Both lungs have a central recession called the hilum, where the blood vessels and airways pass into the
lungs making up the root of the lung.[6] There are also bronchopulmonary lymph nodes on the hilum.[5]
The lungs are surrounded by the pulmonary pleurae. The pleurae are two serous membranes; the outer
parietal pleura lines the inner wall of the rib cage and the inner visceral pleura directly lines the surface of
the lungs. Between the pleurae is a potential space called the pleural cavity containing a thin layer of
lubricating pleural fluid.
Each lung is divided into sections called lobes by
the infoldings of the visceral pleura as fissures.
Lobes are divided into segments, and segments
have further divisions as lobules. There are three
lobes in the right lung and two lobes in the left
lung.
The fissures are formed in early prenatal
development by invaginations of the visceral
pleura that divide the lobar bronchi, and section
the lungs into lobes that helps in their
expansion.[8][9] The right lung is divided into
three lobes by a horizontal fissure, and an
oblique fissure. The left lung is divided into two
lobes by an oblique fissure which is closely
aligned with the oblique fissure in the right lung.
In the right lung the upper horizontal fissure,
separates the upper (superior) lobe from the middle lobe. The lower, oblique fissure separates the lower lobe
from the middle and upper lobes.[3][9]
Variations in the fissures are fairly common being either incompletely formed or present as an extra fissure
as in the azygos fissure, or absent. Incomplete fissures are responsible for interlobar collateral ventilation,
airflow between lobes which is unwanted in some lung volume reduction procedures.[8]
The main or primary bronchi enter the lungs at the hilum and initially branch into secondary bronchi also
known as lobar bronchi that supply air to each lobe of the lung. The lobar bronchi branch into tertiary
bronchi also known as segmental bronchi and these supply air to the further divisions of the lobes known as
bronchopulmonary segments. Each bronchopulmonary segment has its own (segmental) bronchus and

useful clinically for localising disease processes in the lungs.[7] A segment is a discrete unit that can be
surgically removed without seriously affecting surrounding tissue.[11]
The left lung (left) and right lung (right). The lobes of the lungs can be seen, and the central root of the lung is also
present.
The right lung has both more lobes and segments than the left. It is divided into three lobes, an upper,
middle, and a lower lobe by two fissures, one oblique and one horizontal.[12] The upper, horizontal fissure,
separates the upper from the middle lobe. It begins in the lower oblique fissure near the posterior border of
the lung, and, running horizontally forward, cuts the anterior border on a level with the sternal end of the
fourth costal cartilage; on the mediastinal surface it may be traced back to the hilum.[3] The lower, oblique
fissure, separates the lower from the middle and upper lobes and is closely aligned with the oblique fissure
in the left lung.[3][9]
The mediastinal surface of the right lung is indented by a number of nearby structures. The heart sits in an
impression called the cardiac impression. Above the hilum of the lung is an arched groove for the azygos
vein, and above this is a wide groove for the superior vena cava and right brachiocephalic vein; behind this,
and close to the top of the lung is a groove for the brachiocephalic artery. There is a groove for the
esophagus behind the hilum and the pulmonary ligament, and near the lower part of the esophageal groove
is a deeper groove for the inferior vena cava before it enters the heart.[5]
The weight of the right lung varies between individuals, with a standard reference range in men of 155–
720 g (0.342–1.587 lb)[13] and in women of 100–590 g (0.22–1.30 lb).[14]
The left lung is divided into two lobes, an upper and a lower lobe, by the oblique fissure, which extends
from the costal to the mediastinal surface of the lung both above and below the hilum.[3] The left lung,
unlike the right, does not have a middle lobe, though it does have a homologous feature, a projection of the
upper lobe termed the lingula. Its name means "little tongue". The lingula on the left lung serves as an
anatomic parallel to the middle lobe on the right lung, with both areas being predisposed to similar
infections and anatomic complications.[15][16] There are two bronchopulmonary segments of the lingula:
superior and inferior.[3]
Right lung
Left lung
The mediastinal surface of the left lung has a large cardiac impression where the heart sits. This is deeper
and larger than that on the right lung, at which level the heart projects to the left.[5]
On the same surface, immediately above the hilum, is a well-marked curved groove for the aortic arch, and
a groove below it for the descending aorta. The left subclavian artery, a branch off the aortic arch, sits in a
groove from the arch to near the apex of the lung. A shallower groove in front of the artery and near the
edge of the lung, lodges the left brachiocephalic vein. The esophagus may sit in a wider shallow impression
at the base of the lung.[5]
By standard reference range, the weight of the left lung is 110–675 g (0.243–1.488 lb)[13] in men and 105–
515 g (0.231–1.135 lb) in women.[14]

The lungs are part of the lower respiratory tract, and accommodate the bronchial airways when they branch
from the trachea. The bronchial airways terminate in alveoli which make up the functional tissue
(parenchyma) of the lung, and veins, arteries, nerves, and lymphatic vessels.[5][17] The trachea and bronchi
have plexuses of lymph capillaries in their mucosa and submucosa. The smaller bronchi have a single layer
of lymph capillaries, and they are absent in the alveoli.[18] The lungs are supplied with the largest lymphatic

drainage system of any other organ in the body.[19] Each
lung is surrounded by a serous membrane of visceral
pleura, which has an underlying layer of loose connective
tissue attached to the substance of the lung.[20]
The connective tissue of the lungs is made up of elastic
and collagen fibres that are interspersed between the
capillaries and the alveolar walls. Elastin is the key protein
of the extracellular matrix and is the main component of
the elastic fibres.[21] Elastin gives the necessary elasticity
and resilience required for the persistent stretching
involved in breathing, known as lung compliance. It is
also responsible for the elastic recoil needed. Elastin is more
concentrated in areas of high stress such as the openings of the
alveoli, and alveolar junctions.[21] The connective tissue links all
the alveoli to form the lung parenchyma which has a sponge-like
appearance. The alveoli have interconnecting air passages in their
walls known as the pores of Kohn.[22]
All of the lower respiratory tract including the trachea, bronchi, and
bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated
epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucin the
main component of mucus, ciliated cells, basal cells, and in the
terminal bronchioles–club cells with actions similar to basal cells,
and macrophages. The epithelial cells, and the submucosal glands
throughout the respiratory tract secrete airway surface liquid (ASL),
the composition of which is tightly regulated and determines how
well mucociliary clearance works.[23]
Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are found throughout the
respiratory epithelium including the alveolar epithelium,[24] though
they only account for around 0.5 percent of the total epithelial
population.[25] PNECs are innervated airway epithelial cells that are
particularly focused at airway junction points.[25] These cells can
produce serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, as well as
polypeptide products. Cytoplasmic processes from the pulmonary
neuroendocrine cells extend into the airway lumen where they may sense the composition of inspired
gas.[26]

Bronchial airways
A lobule of the lung enclosed in

respiratory bronchiole supplies the
alveoli held in each acinus
accompanied by a pulmonary artery
branch.
Alveoli and their capillary networks
In the bronchi there are incomplete tracheal rings of cartilage and smaller plates of cartilage that keep them
open.[27]: 
472  Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this
is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium.[27]: 
472  The
absence of cartilage in the terminal bronchioles gives them an alternative name of membranous
bronchioles.[28]
The conducting zone of the respiratory tract ends at the terminal
bronchioles when they branch into the respiratory bronchioles. This
marks the beginning of the terminal respiratory unit called the
acinus which includes the respiratory bronchioles, the alveolar
ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli.[29] An acinus measures up to
10 mm in diameter.[30] A primary pulmonary lobule is the part of
the lung distal to the respiratory bronchiole.[31] Thus, it includes the
alveolar ducts, sacs, and alveoli but not the respiratory
bronchioles.[32]
The unit described as the secondary pulmonary lobule is the
lobule most referred to as the pulmonary lobule or respiratory
lobule.[27]: 
489 
[33] This lobule is a discrete unit that is the smallest
component of the lung that can be seen without aid.[31] The
secondary pulmonary lobule is likely to be made up of between 30
and 50 primary lobules.[32] The lobule is supplied by a terminal
bronchiole that branches into respiratory bronchioles. The
respiratory bronchioles supply the alveoli in each acinus and is
accompanied by a pulmonary artery branch. Each lobule is enclosed by an interlobular septum. Each acinus
is incompletely separated by an intralobular septum.[30]
The respiratory bronchiole gives rise to the alveolar ducts that lead to the alveolar sacs, which contain two
or more alveoli.[22] The walls of the alveoli are extremely thin allowing a fast rate of diffusion. The alveoli
have interconnecting small air passages in their walls known as the pores of Kohn.[22]
Alveoli consist of two types of alveolar cell and an alveolar
macrophage. The two types of cell are known as type I and type II
cells[34] (also known as pneumocytes).[5] Types I and II make up
the walls and alveolar septa. Type I cells provide 95% of the surface
area of each alveoli and are flat ("squamous"), and Type II cells
generally cluster in the corners of the alveoli and have a cuboidal
shape.[35] Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or
6:4.[34][35]
Type I are squamous epithelial cells that make up the alveolar wall
structure. They have extremely thin walls that enable an easy gas
exchange.[34] These type I cells also make up the alveolar septa which separate each alveolus. The septa

membranes.[35] Type I cells are not able to divide, and
consequently rely on differentiation from Type II cells.[35]
Type II are larger and they line the alveoli and produce and secrete
epithelial lining fluid, and lung surfactant.[36][34] Type II cells are
able to divide and differentiate to Type I cells.[35]
The alveolar macrophages have an important role in the immune
system. They remove substances which deposit in the alveoli
including loose red blood cells that have been forced out from
blood vessels.[35]
There is a large presence of microorganisms in the lungs known as the lung microbiota that interacts with
the airway epithelial cells; an interaction of probable importance in maintaining homeostasis. The
microbiota is complex and dynamic in healthy people, and altered in diseases such as asthma and COPD.
For example significant changes can take place in COPD following infection with rhinovirus.[37] Fungal
genera that are commonly found as mycobiota in the microbiota include Candida, Malassezia,
Saccharomyces, and Aspergillus.[38][39]
The lower respiratory tract is part of the respiratory system, and consists of
the trachea and the structures below this including the lungs.[34] The
trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place where it
splits (the carina) into a right and left primary bronchus. These supply air to
the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary and
tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller
bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. These in turn
supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of
gases take place.[34] Oxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the
alveoli into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation,[22] and
carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.
Estimates of the total surface area of lungs vary from 50 to 75 square metres
(540 to 810 sq ft);[34][35] although this is often quoted in textbooks and the
media being "the size of a tennis court",[35][40][41] it is actually less than half the size of a singles court.[42]
The bronchi in the conducting zone are reinforced with hyaline cartilage in order to hold open the airways.
The bronchioles have no cartilage and are surrounded instead by smooth muscle.[35] Air is warmed to
37 °C (99 °F), humidified and cleansed by the conducting zone. Particles from the air being removed by the
cilia on the respiratory epithelium lining the passageways,[43] in a process called mucociliary clearance.

The anterior thoracic wall, the airways and the
pulmonary vessels anterior to the root of the lung have
been digitally removed in order to visualize the different
levels of the pulmonary circulation.
Pulmonary stretch receptors in the smooth muscle of the airways initiate a reflex known as the Hering–
Breuer reflex that prevents the lungs from over-inflation, during forceful inspiration.
The lungs have a dual blood supply provided by a
bronchial and a pulmonary circulation.[6] The
bronchial circulation supplies oxygenated blood to
the airways of the lungs, through the bronchial
arteries that leave the aorta. There are usually
three arteries, two to the left lung and one to the
right, and they branch alongside the bronchi and
bronchioles.[34] The pulmonary circulation carries
deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs
and returns the oxygenated blood to the heart to
supply the rest of the body.[34]
The blood volume of the lungs is about 450
millilitres on average, about 9% of the total blood
volume of the entire circulatory system. This
quantity can easily fluctuate from between one-
half and twice the normal volume. Also, in the
event of blood loss through hemorrhage, blood
from the lungs can partially compensate by automatically transferring to the systemic circulation.[44]
The lungs are supplied by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Input from the parasympathetic nervous
system occurs via the vagus nerve.[6] When stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the
smooth muscle lining the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands.[45] The lungs
also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 adrenoceptors in the respiratory tract,
which causes bronchodilation.[46]
The action of breathing takes place because of nerve signals sent by the respiratory center in the brainstem,
along the phrenic nerve from the cervical plexus to the diaphragm.[47]
The lobes of the lung are subject to anatomical variations.[48] A horizontal interlobar fissure was found to be
incomplete in 25% of right lungs, or even absent in 11% of all cases. An accessory fissure was also found in
14% and 22% of left and right lungs, respectively.[49] An oblique fissure was found to be incomplete in
21% to 47% of left lungs.[50] In some cases a fissure is absent, or extra, resulting in a right lung with only
two lobes, or a left lung with three lobes.[48]

Variation
Lungs during development, showing
the early branching of the primitive
bronchial buds
A variation in the airway branching structure has been found specifically in the central airway branching.
This variation is associated with the development of COPD in adulthood.[51]
The development of the human lungs arise from the laryngotracheal groove and develop to maturity over
several weeks in the foetus and for several years following birth.[52]
The larynx, trachea, bronchi and lungs that make up the respiratory tract, begin to form during the fourth
week of embryogenesis[53] from the lung bud which appears ventrally to the caudal portion of the
foregut.[54]
The respiratory tract has a branching structure, and is also known as
the respiratory tree.[55] In the embryo this structure is developed in
the process of branching morphogenesis,[56] and is generated by the
repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. In the development of the
lungs (as in some other organs) the epithelium forms branching
tubes. The lung has a left-right symmetry and each bud known as a
bronchial bud grows out as a tubular epithelium that becomes a
bronchus. Each bronchus branches into bronchioles.[57] The
branching is a result of the tip of each tube bifurcating.[55] The
branching process forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately
the alveoli.[55] The four genes mostly associated with branching
morphogenesis in the lung are the intercellular signalling protein –
sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and bone morphogenetic protein
BMP4. FGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. FGF10 is a paracrine signalling molecule needed
for epithelial branching, and SHH inhibits FGF10.[55][57] The development of the alveoli is influenced by a
different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the
alveoli.
At the end of the fourth week the lung bud divides into two, the right and left primary bronchial buds on
each side of the trachea.[58][59] During the fifth week the right bud branches into three secondary bronchial
buds and the left branches into two secondary bronchial buds. These give rise to the lobes of the lungs,
three on the right and two on the left. Over the following week, the secondary buds branch into tertiary
buds, about ten on each side.[59] From the sixth week to the sixteenth week, the major elements of the lungs
appear except the alveoli.[60] From week 16 to week 26, the bronchi enlarge and lung tissue becomes
highly vascularised. Bronchioles and alveolar ducts also develop. By week 26 the terminal bronchioles
have formed which branch into two respiratory bronchioles.[61] During the period covering the 26th week
until birth the important blood–air barrier is established. Specialised type I alveolar cells where gas
exchange will take place, together with the type II alveolar cells that secrete pulmonary surfactant, appear.
The surfactant reduces the surface tension at the air-alveolar surface which allows expansion of the alveolar
sacs. The alveolar sacs contain the primitive alveoli that form at the end of the alveolar ducts,[62] and their
appearance around the seventh month marks the point at which limited respiration would be possible, and
the premature baby could survive.[52]
Development
Vitamin A deficiency
The developing lung is particularly vulnerable to changes in the levels of vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency
has been linked to changes in the epithelial lining of the lung and in the lung parenchyma. This can disrupt
the normal physiology of the lung and predispose to respiratory diseases. Severe nutritional deficiency in
vitamin A results in a reduction in the formation of the alveolar walls (septa) and to notable changes in the
respiratory epithelium; alterations are noted in the extracellular matrix and in the protein content of the
basement membrane. The extracellular matrix maintains lung elasticity; the basement membrane is
associated with alveolar epithelium and is important in the blood-air barrier. The deficiency is associated
with functional defects and disease states. Vitamin A is crucial in the development of the alveoli which
continues for several years after birth.[63]
At birth, the baby's lungs are filled with fluid secreted by the lungs and are not inflated. After birth the
infant's central nervous system reacts to the sudden change in temperature and environment. This triggers
the first breath, within about 10 seconds after delivery.[64] Before birth, the lungs are filled with fetal lung
fluid.[65] After the first breath, the fluid is quickly absorbed into the body or exhaled. The resistance in the
lung's blood vessels decreases giving an increased surface area for gas exchange, and the lungs begin to
breathe spontaneously. This accompanies other changes which result in an increased amount of blood
entering the lung tissues.[64]
At birth the lungs are very undeveloped with only around one sixth of the alveoli of the adult lung
present.[52] The alveoli continue to form into early adulthood, and their ability to form when necessary is
seen in the regeneration of the lung.[66][67] Alveolar septa have a double capillary network instead of the
single network of the developed lung. Only after the maturation of the capillary network can the lung enter
a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the
alveoli being enlarged.[68]
The major function of the lungs is gas exchange between the lungs and the blood.[69] The alveolar and
pulmonary capillary gases equilibrate across the thin blood–air barrier.[36][70][71] This thin membrane
(about 0.5 –2 μm thick) is folded into about 300 million alveoli, providing an extremely large surface area
(estimates varying between 70 and 145 m2) for gas exchange to occur.[70][72]
The lungs are not capable of expanding to breathe on their own, and will only do so when there is an
increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity.[73] This is achieved by the muscles of respiration, through the
contraction of the diaphragm, and the intercostal muscles which pull the rib cage upwards as shown in the
diagram.[74] During breathing out the muscles relax, returning the lungs to their resting position.[75] At this
point the lungs contain the functional residual capacity (FRC) of air, which, in the adult human, has a
volume of about 2.5–3.0 litres.[75]
After birth
Function
Gas exchange
The effect of the respiratory muscles
in expanding the rib cage
During heavy breathing as in exertion, a large number of accessory
muscles in the neck and abdomen are recruited, that during
exhalation pull the ribcage down, decreasing the volume of the
thoracic cavity.[75] The FRC is now decreased, but since the lungs
cannot be emptied completely there is still about a litre of residual
air left.[75] Lung function testing is carried out to evaluate lung
volumes and capacities.
The lungs possess several characteristics which protect against
infection. The respiratory tract is lined by respiratory epithelium or
respiratory mucosa, with hair-like projections called cilia that beat rhythmically and carry mucus. This
mucociliary clearance is an important defence system against air-borne infection.[36] The dust particles and
bacteria in the inhaled air are caught in the mucosal surface of the airways, and are moved up towards the
pharynx by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia.[35][76]: 
661–730  The lining of the lung also
secretes immunoglobulin A which protects against respiratory infections;[76] goblet cells secrete mucus[35]
which also contains several antimicrobial compounds such as defensins, antiproteases, and antioxidants.[76]
A rare type of specialised cell called a pulmonary ionocyte that is suggested may regulate mucus viscosity
has been described.[77][78][79] In addition, the lining of the lung also contains macrophages, immune cells
which engulf and destroy debris and microbes that enter the lung in a process known as phagocytosis; and
dendritic cells which present antigens to activate components of the adaptive immune system such as T cells
and B cells.[76]
The size of the respiratory tract and the flow of air also protect the lungs from larger particles. Smaller
particles deposit in the mouth and behind the mouth in the oropharynx, and larger particles are trapped in
nasal hair after inhalation.[76]
In addition to their function in respiration, the lungs have a number of other functions. They are involved in
maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure as part of the renin–angiotensin
system. The inner lining of the blood vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme
that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.[80] The lungs are involved in the blood's
acid–base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.[73][81]
The lungs also serve a protective role. Several blood-borne substances, such as a few types of
prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are excreted through the lungs.[80] Drugs and other
substances can be absorbed, modified or excreted in the lungs.[73][82] The lungs filter out small blood clots
from veins and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.[81]
The lungs also play a pivotal role in speech by providing air and airflow for the creation of vocal
sounds,[73][83] and other paralanguage communications such as sighs and gasps.
Research suggests a role of the lungs in the production of blood platelets.[84]

Gene and protein expression
Tissue death of the lung due to a

About 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and almost 75% of these genes are
expressed in the normal lung.[85][86] A little less than 200 of these genes are more specifically expressed in
the lung with less than 20 genes being highly lung specific. The highest expression of lung specific proteins
are different surfactant proteins,[36] such as SFTPA1, SFTPB and SFTPC, and napsin, expressed in type II
pneumocytes. Other proteins with elevated expression in the lung are the dynein protein DNAH5 in ciliated
cells, and the secreted SCGB1A1 protein in mucus-secreting goblet cells of the airway mucosa.[87]
Lungs can be affected by a number of diseases and disorders. Pulmonology is the medical speciality that
deals with respiratory diseases involving the lungs and respiratory system.[88] Cardiothoracic surgery deals
with surgery of the lungs including lung volume reduction surgery, lobectomy, pneumectomy and lung
transplantation.[89]
Inflammatory conditions of the lung tissue are pneumonia, of the respiratory tract are bronchitis and
bronchiolitis, and of the pleurae surrounding the lungs pleurisy. Inflammation is usually caused by
infections due to bacteria or viruses. When the lung tissue is inflamed due to other causes it is called
pneumonitis. One major cause of bacterial pneumonia is tuberculosis.[76] Chronic infections often occur in
those with immunodeficiency and can include a fungal infection by Aspergillus fumigatus that can lead to
an aspergilloma forming in the lung.[76][90] In the US certain species of rat can transmit a hantavirus to
humans that can cause untreatable hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with a similar presentation to that of
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).[91]
Alcohol affects the lungs and can cause inflammatory alcoholic lung disease. Acute exposure to alcohol
stimulates the beating of cilia in the respiratory epithelium. However, chronic exposure has the effect of
desensitising the ciliary response which reduces mucociliary clearance (MCC). MCC is an innate defense
system protecting against pollutants and pathogens, and when this is disrupted the numbers of alveolar
macrophages are decreased. A subsequent inflammatory response is the release of cytokines. Another
consequence is the susceptibility to infection.[92][93]
A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that becomes lodged in the
pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep
vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated
using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the
lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer.[76] Pulmonary
hypertension describes an increased pressure at the beginning of the
pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes.[76]
Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung,
such 
as 
granulomatosis 
with 
polyangiitis, 
which 
causes
inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and
kidneys.[76]

A lung contusion is a bruise caused by chest trauma. It results in hemorrhage of the alveoli causing a build-
up of fluid which can impair breathing, and this can be either mild or severe. The function of the lungs can
also be affected by compression from fluid in the pleural cavity pleural effusion, or other substances such as
air (pneumothorax), blood (hemothorax), or rarer causes. These may be investigated using a chest X-ray or
CT scan, and may require the insertion of a surgical drain until the underlying cause is identified and
treated.[76]
Asthma, bronchiectasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) that includes chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, are all
obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This
limits the amount of air that is able to enter alveoli because of
constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive
lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and
diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry.
Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers
(such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as
bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as
through corticosteroids) in severe cases. A common cause of
chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, is smoking; and common
causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic
fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known, but it has
been linked to other atopic diseases.[76][94]
The breakdown of alveolar tissue, often as a result of tobacco-
smoking leads to emphysema, which can become severe enough to
develop into COPD. Elastase breaks down the elastin in the lung's
connective tissue that can also result in emphysema. Elastase is
inhibited by the acute-phase protein, alpha-1 antitrypsin, and when
there is a deficiency in this, emphysema can develop. With persistent stress from smoking, the airway basal
cells become disarranged and lose their regenerative ability needed to repair the epithelial barrier. The
disorganised basal cells are seen to be responsible for the major airway changes that are characteristic of
COPD, and with continued stress can undergo a malignant transformation. Studies have shown that the
initial development of emphysema is centred on the early changes in the airway epithelium of the small
airways.[95] Basal cells become further deranged in a smoker's transition to clinically defined COPD.[95]
Some types of chronic lung diseases are classified as restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction in the
amount of lung tissue involved in respiration. These include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur when the
lung is inflamed for a long period of time. Fibrosis in the lung replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous
connective tissue. This can be due to a large variety of occupational lung diseases such as Coalworker's
Obstructive lung diseases
Restrictive lung diseases
pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.[76] Severe respiratory
disorders, where spontaneous breathing is not enough to maintain life, may need the use of mechanical
ventilation to ensure an adequate supply of air.
Lung cancer can either arise directly from lung tissue or as a result of metastasis from another part of the
body. There are two main types of primary tumour described as either small-cell or non-small-cell lung
carcinomas. The major risk factor for cancer is smoking. Once a cancer is identified it is staged using scans
such as a CT scan and a sample of tissue from a biopsy is taken. Cancers may be treated surgically by
removing the tumour, the use of radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination, or with the aim of symptom
control.[76] Lung cancer screening is being recommended in the United States for high-risk populations.[96]
Congenital disorders include cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypoplasia (an incomplete development of the
lungs)[97]congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and infant respiratory distress syndrome caused by a deficiency
in lung surfactant. An azygos lobe is a congenital anatomical variation which though usually without effect
can cause problems in thoracoscopic procedures.[98]
A pneumothorax (collapsed lung) is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural space that causes an
uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall.[99] The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the
pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural
space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, scuba divers ascending
while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high
pressure air into the pleural space.
As part of a physical examination in response to respiratory symptoms of shortness of breath, and cough, a
lung examination may be carried out. This exam includes palpation and auscultation.[100] The areas of the
lungs that can be listened to using a stethoscope are called the lung fields, and these are the posterior, lateral,
and anterior lung fields. The posterior fields can be listened to from the back and include: the lower lobes
(taking up three quarters of the posterior fields); the anterior fields taking up the other quarter; and the lateral
fields under the axillae, the left axilla for the lingual, the right axilla for the middle right lobe. The anterior
fields can also be auscultated from the front.[101] An area known as the triangle of auscultation is an area of
thinner musculature on the back which allows improved listening.[102] Abnormal breathing sounds heard
during a lung exam can indicate the presence of a lung condition; wheezing for example is commonly
associated with asthma and COPD.
Lung function testing is carried out by evaluating a person's capacity to inhale and exhale in different
circumstances.[103] The volume of air inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally
500–750 mL); the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional amounts a

respectively. The summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a person's vital capacity. Not all air is
expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; the remainder of the air is called the residual volume.
Together these terms are referred to as lung volumes.[103]
Pulmonary plethysmographs are used to measure functional residual capacity.[104] Functional residual
capacity cannot be measured by tests that rely on breathing out, as a person is only able to breathe a
maximum of 80% of their total functional capacity.[105] The total lung capacity depends on the person's
age, height, weight, and sex, and normally ranges between 4 and 6 litres.[103] Females tend to have a 20–
25% lower capacity than males. Tall people tend to have a larger total lung capacity than shorter people.
Smokers have a lower capacity than nonsmokers. Thinner persons tend to have a larger capacity. Lung
capacity can be increased by physical training as much as 40% but the effect may be modified by exposure
to air pollution.[105][106]
Other lung function tests include spirometry, measuring the amount (volume) and flow of air that can be
inhaled and exhaled. The maximum volume of breath that can be exhaled is called the vital capacity. In
particular, how much a person is able to exhale in one second (called forced expiratory volume (FEV1)) as
a proportion of how much they are able to exhale in total (FEV). This ratio, the FEV1/FEV ratio, is
important to distinguish whether a lung disease is restrictive or obstructive.[76][103] Another test is that of
the lung's diffusing capacity – this is a measure of the transfer of gas from air to the blood in the lung
capillaries.
Mammal lung is one of the main types of offal, or pluck, alongside the
heart and trachea, and is consumed as a foodstuff around the world in
dishes such as Scottish haggis. The United States Food and Drug
Administration legally prohibits the sale of animal lungs due concerns
such as fungal spores or cross-contamination with other organs, although
this has been criticized as unfounded.[107]
The lungs of birds are relatively small, but are connected to 8 or 9 air sacs that extend through much of the
body, and are in turn connected to air spaces within the bones. On inhalation, air travels through the trachea
of a bird into the air sacs. Air then travels continuously from the air sacs at the back, through the lungs,

Birds
On inhalation, air travels to air sacs
near the back of a bird. The air then
passes through the lungs to air sacs
near the front of the bird, from where
the air is exhaled.

exchanger in the lungs of birds. Air is
forced from the air sacs
unidirectionally (from left to right in
the diagram) through the parabronchi.
The pulmonary capillaries surround
the parabronchi in the manner shown

parabronchus to above it in the

which are relatively fixed in
size, to the air sacs at the
front. From here, the air is
exhaled. These fixed size
lungs are called "circulatory
lungs", as distinct from the
"bellows-type lungs" found
in 
most 
other
animals.[108][110]
The lungs of birds contain
millions of tiny parallel
passages 
called
parabronchi. 
Small 
sacs
called atria radiate from the
walls of the tiny passages;
these, like the alveoli in
other lungs, are the site of
gas exchange by simple
diffusion.[110] The blood
flow around the parabronchi and their atria forms a cross-current process of gas exchange (see diagram on
the right).[108][109]
The air sacs, which hold air, do not contribute much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, as they are
poorly vascularised. The air sacs expand and contract due to changes in the volume in the thorax and
abdomen. This volume change is caused by the movement of the sternum and ribs and this movement is
often synchronised with movement of the flight muscles.[111]
Parabronchi in which the air flow is unidirectional are called paleopulmonic parabronchi and are found in
all birds. Some birds, however, have, in addition, a lung structure where the air flow in the parabronchi is
bidirectional. These are termed neopulmonic parabronchi.[110]
The lungs of most reptiles have a single bronchus running down the centre, from which numerous branches
reach out to individual pockets throughout the lungs. These pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals, but
much larger and fewer in number. These give the lung a sponge-like texture. In tuataras, snakes, and some
lizards, the lungs are simpler in structure, similar to that of typical amphibians.[111]
Snakes and limbless lizards typically possess only the right lung as a major respiratory organ; the left lung is
greatly reduced, or even absent. Amphisbaenians, however, have the opposite arrangement, with a major
left lung, and a reduced or absent right lung.[111]
Both crocodilians and monitor lizards have lungs similar to those of birds, providing a unidirectional airflow
and even possessing air sacs.[112] The now extinct pterosaurs have seemingly even further refined this type
of lung, extending the airsacs into the wing membranes and, in the case of lonchodectids, tupuxuara, and
azhdarchoids, the hindlimbs.[113]
Reptiles
The axolotl (Ambystoma
mexicanum) retains its larval form
with gills into adulthood.
Reptilian lungs typically receive air via expansion and contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and
buccal pumping. Crocodilians also rely on the hepatic piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a
muscle anchored to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus,[114] which in turn creates
negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law.
Turtles, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air in
and out of the lungs.[111]
The lungs of most frogs and other amphibians are simple and
balloon-like, with gas exchange limited to the outer surface of the
lung. This is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic
demands and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by
diffusion across their skin in water, and supplement their oxygen
supply by the same method. Amphibians employ a positive pressure
system to get air to their lungs, forcing air down into the lungs by
buccal pumping. This is distinct from most higher vertebrates, who
use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where the lungs
are inflated by expanding the rib cage.[115] In buccal pumping, the
floor of the mouth is lowered, filling the mouth cavity with air. The
throat muscles then presses the throat against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into the lungs.[116]
Due to the possibility of respiration across the skin combined with small size, all known lungless tetrapods
are amphibians. The majority of salamander species are lungless salamanders, which respirate through their
skin and tissues lining their mouth. This necessarily restricts their size: all are small and rather thread-like in
appearance, maximising skin surface relative to body volume.[117] Other known lungless tetrapods are the
Bornean flat-headed frog[118] and Atretochoana eiselti, a caecilian.[119]
The lungs of amphibians typically have a few narrow internal walls (septa) of soft tissue around the outer
walls, increasing the respiratory surface area and giving the lung a honeycomb appearance. In some
salamanders even these are lacking, and the lung has a smooth wall. In caecilians, as in snakes, only the
right lung attains any size or development.[111]
Lungs are found in three groups of fish; the coelacanths, the bichirs and the lungfish. Like in tetrapods, but
unlike fish with swim bladder, the opening is at the ventral side of the esophagus. The coelacanth has a
nonfunctional and unpaired vestigial lung surrounded by a fatty organ.[120] Bichirs, the only group of ray-
finned fish with lungs, have a pair which are hollow unchambered sacs, where the gas-exchange occurs on
very flat folds that increase their inner surface area. The lungs of lungfish show more resemblance to
tetrapod lungs. There is an elaborate network of parenchymal septa, dividing them into numerous
respiration chambers.[121][122] In the Australian lungfish, there is only a single lung, albeit divided into two
lobes. Other lungfish, however, have traditionally been considered having two lungs, but newer research
defines paired lungs as bilateral lung buds that arise simultaneously and are both connected directly to the
foregut, which is only seen in tetrapods.[123] In all lungfish, including the Australian, the lungs are located
Amphibians
Fish
Book lungs of a female spider
(shown in pink)
in the upper dorsal part of the body, with the connecting duct curving around and above the esophagus. The
blood supply also twists around the esophagus, suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral
part of the body, as in other vertebrates.[111]
A number of invertebrates have lung-like structures that serve a
similar respiratory purpose to true vertebrate lungs, but are not
evolutionarily related and only arise out of convergent evolution.
Some arachnids, such as spiders and scorpions, have structures
called book lungs used for atmospheric gas exchange. Some species
of spider have four pairs of book lungs but most have two
pairs.[124] Scorpions have spiracles on their body for the entrance
of air to the book lungs.[125]
The coconut crab is terrestrial and uses structures called branchiostegal lungs to breathe air.[126] Juveniles
are released into the ocean, however adults cannot swim and possess an only rudimentary set of gills. The
adult crabs can breathe on land and hold their breath underwater.[127] The branchiostegal lungs are seen as
a developmental adaptive stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.[128]
Pulmonates are mostly land snails and slugs that have developed a simple lung from the mantle cavity. An
externally located opening called the pneumostome allows air to be taken into the mantle cavity
lung.[129][130]
The lungs of today's terrestrial vertebrates and the gas bladders of today's fish are believed to have evolved
from simple sacs, as outpocketings of the esophagus, that allowed early fish to gulp air under oxygen-poor
conditions.[131] These outpocketings first arose in the bony fish. In most of the ray-finned fish the sacs
evolved into closed off gas bladders, while a number of carp, trout, herring, catfish, and eels have retained
the physostome condition with the sac being open to the esophagus. In more basal bony fish, such as the
gar, bichir, bowfin and the lobe-finned fish, the bladders have evolved to primarily function as lungs.[131]
The lobe-finned fish gave rise to the land-based tetrapods. Thus, the lungs of vertebrates are homologous to
the gas bladders of fish (but not to their gills).[132]
