Root of the lung
The root of the lung is a group of structures that emerge at the
hilum of each lung, just above the middle of the mediastinal
surface and behind the cardiac impression of the lung. It is
nearer to the back (posterior border) than the front (anterior
border). The root of the lung is connected by the structures that
form it to the heart and the trachea.[1] The rib cage is separated
from the lung by a two-layered membranous coating, the
pleura. The hilum is the large triangular depression where the
connection between the parietal pleura (covering the rib cage)
and the visceral pleura (covering the lung) is made, and this
marks the meeting point between the mediastinum and the
pleural cavities.
The root of the right lung lies behind the superior vena cava
and part of the right atrium, and below the azygos vein. That of
the left lung passes beneath the aortic arch and in front of the
descending aorta; the phrenic nerve, pericardiacophrenic artery
and vein, and the anterior pulmonary plexus, lie in front of
each, and the vagus nerve and posterior pulmonary plexus lie
behind.[1]
The root is formed by the bronchus, the pulmonary artery, the
pulmonary veins, the bronchial arteries and veins, the
pulmonary plexuses of nerves, lymphatic vessels, bronchial
lymph nodes, and areolar tissue, all of which are enclosed by a
reflection of the pleura. The chief structures composing the root
of each lung are arranged in a similar manner from the front to
the back on each side. This means that the upper of the two
pulmonary veins are located anteriorly, the pulmonary artery is
in the middle, and the bronchus and bronchial vessels are
located posteriorly.[1] The arrangement on the two sides is not
symmetrical.[2]
Right side: (superior to inferior) eparterial bronchus, pulmonary
artery, hyparterial bronchus, and inferior pulmonary vein.[2]

Anatomical terminology
Left side: (superior to inferior) pulmonary artery, main
bronchus, and inferior pulmonary vein.[2]
On each hilum, there are hilar bronchopulmonary lymph nodes.
The visceral-parietal reflection surrounding the root of the lung extends downwards from the hilum to near
the base of the lower lobe in a sleeve-like fold called the pulmonary ligament. The lower rounded edge of
this is sometimes referred to as the inferior pulmonary ligament. At the lower edge of each lung, the pleural
layers come into contact with each other, and terminate in a free curved edge. The pulmonary ligaments
serve to anchor the larger lower lobes of the lungs in position and prevent potential torsion.
On chest X-ray, hilar enlargement can be due to lymphadenopathy and tumours (tuberculosis, bronchogenic
carcinoma, lymphoma, and sarcoidosis), pulmonary hypertension or simply due to increased lung blood
flow.[3]
