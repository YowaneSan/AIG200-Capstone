Anatomical terminology
Pulmonary alveolus
A pulmonary alveolus (pl.: alveoli, from Latin alveolus, "little
cavity"), also known as an air sac or air space, is one of
millions of hollow, distensible cup-shaped cavities in the lungs
where pulmonary gas exchange takes place.[1] Oxygen is
exchanged for carbon dioxide at the blood–air barrier between
the alveolar air and the pulmonary capillary.[2] Alveoli make up
the functional tissue of the mammalian lungs known as the lung
parenchyma, which takes up 90 percent of the total lung
volume.[3][4]
Alveoli are first located in the respiratory bronchioles that mark
the beginning of the respiratory zone. They are located sparsely
in these bronchioles, line the walls of the alveolar ducts, and are
more numerous in the blind-ended alveolar sacs.[5] The acini
are the basic units of respiration, with gas exchange taking
place in all the alveoli present.[6] The alveolar membrane is the
gas exchange surface, surrounded by a network of capillaries.
Oxygen is diffused across the membrane into the capillaries and
carbon dioxide is released from the capillaries into the alveoli to
be breathed out.[7][8]
Alveoli are particular to mammalian lungs. Different structures
are involved in gas exchange in other vertebrates.[9]
The alveoli are first located in the respiratory bronchioles as
scattered outpockets, extending from their lumens. The
respiratory bronchioles run for considerable lengths and
become increasingly alveolated with side branches of alveolar
ducts that become deeply lined with alveoli. The ducts number
between two and eleven from each bronchiole.[10] Each duct
opens into five or six alveolar sacs into which clusters of
alveoli open.
Each terminal respiratory unit is called an acinus and consists of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts,
alveolar sacs, and alveoli. New alveoli continue to form until the age of eight years.[5]

sac
A typical pair of human lungs contains about 480
million alveoli,[11] providing a total surface area for
gas exchange of between 70 and 80 square
metres.[10] Each alveolus is wrapped in a fine mesh
of capillaries covering about 70% of its area.[12] The
diameter of an alveolus is between 200 and 500
μm.[12]
An alveolus consists of an epithelial layer of simple
squamous epithelium (very thin, flattened cells),[13]
and an extracellular matrix surrounded by capillaries.
The epithelial lining is part of the alveolar membrane,
also known as the respiratory membrane, that allows
the exchange of gases. The membrane has several
layers – a layer of alveolar lining fluid that contains
surfactant, the epithelial layer and its basement
membrane; a thin interstitial space between the epithelial lining and the capillary membrane; a capillary
basement membrane that often fuses with the alveolar basement membrane, and the capillary endothelial
membrane. The whole membrane however is only between 0.2 μm at its thinnest part and 0.6 μm at its
thickest.[14]
In the alveolar walls there are interconnecting air passages between the alveoli known as the pores of
Kohn. The alveolar septum that separates the alveoli in the alveolar sac contains some collagen fibers and
elastic fibers. The septa also house the enmeshed capillary network that surrounds each alveolus.[3] The
elastic fibres allow the alveoli to stretch when they fill with air during inhalation. They then spring back
during exhalation in order to expel the carbon dioxide-rich air.
There are three major types of alveolar cell. Two types are
pneumocytes or pneumonocytes known as type I and type II cells
found in the alveolar wall, and a large phagocytic cell known as an
alveolar macrophage that moves about in the lumens of the alveoli,
and in the connective tissue between them. Type I cells, also called
type I pneumocytes, or type I alveolar cells, are squamous, thin and
flat and form the structure of the alveoli. Type II cells, also called
type II pneumocytes or type II alveolar cells, release pulmonary
surfactant to lower surface tension, and can also differentiate to
replace damaged type I cells.[12][15]
Development of the earliest structures that will contain alveoli begins on day 22 and is divided into five
stages: embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular, and alveolar stage.[16] The alveolar stage begins
approximately 36 weeks into development. Immature alveoli appear as bulges from the sacculi which
invade the primary septa. As the sacculi develop, the protrusions in the primary septa become larger; new
septations are longer and thinner and are known as secondary septa.[16] Secondary septa are responsible for
Microanatomy
Development

cross section is magnified to show
diffusion of oxygen gas and carbon
dioxide through type I cells and
capillary cells.
Gas exchange in the alveolus
the final division of the sacculi into alveoli. Majority of alveolar division occurs within the first 6 months but
continue to develop until 3 years of age. To create a thinner diffusion barrier, the double-layer capillary
network fuse into one network, each one closely associated with two alveoli as they develop.[16]
In the first three years of life, the enlargement of lungs is a consequence of the increasing number of alveoli;
after this point, both the number and size of alveoli increases until the development of lungs finishes at
approximately 8 years of age.[16]
Type I cells are the larger of the two cell types; they are thin, flat
epithelial lining cells (membranous pneumocytes), that form the
structure of the alveoli.[3] They are squamous (giving more surface
area to each cell) and have long cytoplasmic extensions that cover
more than 95% of the alveolar surface.[12][17]
Type I cells are involved in the process of gas exchange between
the alveoli and blood. These cells are extremely thin – sometimes
only 25 nm – the electron microscope was needed to prove that all
alveoli are lined with epithelium. This thin lining enables a fast
diffusion of gas exchange between the air in the alveoli and the
blood in the surrounding capillaries.
The nucleus of a type I cell occupies a large area of free cytoplasm
and its organelles are clustered around it reducing the thickness of
the cell. This also keeps the thickness of the blood-air barrier
reduced to a minimum.
The cytoplasm in the thin portion contains pinocytotic vesicles
which may play a role in the removal of small particulate
contaminants from the outer surface. In addition to desmosomes, all
type I alveolar cells have occluding junctions that prevent the
leakage of tissue fluid into the alveolar air space.
The relatively low solubility (and hence rate of diffusion) of oxygen
necessitates the large internal surface area (about 80 square m [96
square yards]) and very thin walls of the alveoli. Weaving between
the capillaries and helping to support them is an extracellular matrix,
a meshlike fabric of elastic and collagenous fibres. The collagen
fibres, being more rigid, give the wall firmness, while the elastic
fibres permit expansion and contraction of the walls during
breathing.
Function
Type I cells
Type I pneumocytes are unable to replicate and are susceptible to toxic insults. In the event of damage, type
II cells can proliferate and differentiate into type I cells to compensate.[18]
Type II cells are cuboidal and much smaller than type I cells.[3] They are the most numerous cells in the
alveoli, yet do not cover as much surface area as the squamous type I cells.[18] Type II cells (granulous
pneumocytes) in the alveolar wall contain secretory organelles known as lamellar bodies or lamellar
granules, that fuse with the cell membranes and secrete pulmonary surfactant. This surfactant is a film of
fatty substances, a group of phospholipids that reduce alveolar surface tension. The phospholipids are stored
in the lamellar bodies. Without this coating, the alveoli would collapse. The surfactant is continuously
released by exocytosis. Reinflation of the alveoli following exhalation is made easier by the surfactant,
which reduces surface tension in the thin fluid lining of the alveoli. The fluid coating is produced by the
body in order to facilitate the transfer of gases between blood and alveolar air, and the type II cells are
typically found at the blood–air barrier.[19][20]
Type II cells start to develop at about 26 weeks of gestation, secreting small amounts of surfactant.
However, adequate amounts of surfactant are not secreted until about 35 weeks of gestation – this is the
main reason for increased rates of infant respiratory distress syndrome, which drastically reduces at ages
above 35 weeks gestation.
Type II cells are also capable of cellular division, giving rise to more type I and II alveolar cells when the
lung tissue is damaged.[21]
MUC1, a human gene associated with type II pneumocytes, has been identified as a marker in lung
cancer.[22]
The importance of the type 2 lung alveolar cells in the development of severe respiratory symptoms of
COVID-19 and potential mechanisms on how these cells are protected by the SSRIs fluvoxamine and
fluoxetine was summarized in a review in April 2022.[23]
The alveolar macrophages reside on the internal luminal surfaces of the alveoli, the alveolar ducts, and the
bronchioles. They are mobile scavengers that serve to engulf foreign particles in the lungs, such as dust,
bacteria, carbon particles, and blood cells from injuries.[24] They are also called pulmonary macrophages,
and dust cells.
Insufficient surfactant in the alveoli is one of the causes that can contribute to atelectasis (collapse of part or
all of the lung). Without pulmonary surfactant, atelectasis is a certainty.[25] The severe condition of acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of surfactant.[26]

Insufficient surfactant in the lungs of preterm infants causes infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS).
The lecithin–sphingomyelin ratio is a measure of fetal amniotic fluid to indicate lung maturity or
immaturity.[27] A low ratio indicates a risk factor for IRDS. Lecithin and sphingomyelin are two of the
glycolipids of pulmonary surfactant.
Impaired surfactant regulation can cause an accumulation of surfactant proteins to build up in the alveoli in
a condition called pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. This results in impaired gas exchange.[28]
Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung tissue, which can be caused by both viruses and
bacteria. Cytokines and fluids are released into the alveolar cavity, interstitium, or both, in response to
infection, causing the effective surface area of gas exchange to be reduced. In severe cases where cellular
respiration cannot be maintained, supplemental oxygen may be required.[29][30]
Diffuse alveolar damage can be a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) a
severe inflammatory disease of the lung.[31]: 
187 
In asthma, the bronchioles become narrowed, causing the amount of air flow into the lung
tissue to be greatly reduced. It can be triggered by irritants in the air, photochemical smog for
example, as well as substances to which a person is allergic.
Chronic bronchitis occurs when an abundance of mucus is produced by the lungs. The
production of mucus occurs naturally when the lung tissue is exposed to irritants. In chronic
bronchitis, the air passages into the alveoli, the respiratory bronchioles, become clogged
with mucus. This causes increased coughing in order to remove the mucus, and is often a
result of extended periods of exposure to cigarette smoke.
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
Almost any type of lung tumor or lung cancer can compress the
alveoli and reduce gas exchange capacity. In some cases the tumor
will fill the alveoli.[32]
Cavitary pneumonia is a process in which the alveoli are
destroyed and produce a cavity. As the alveoli are
destroyed, the surface area for gas exchange to occur
becomes reduced. Further changes in blood flow can
lead to decline in lung function.
Emphysema is another disease of the lungs, whereby
the elastin in the walls of the alveoli is broken down by
an imbalance between the production of neutrophil
elastase (elevated by cigarette smoke) and alpha-1
antitrypsin (the activity varies due to genetics or reaction
of a critical methionine residue with toxins including
cigarette smoke). The resulting loss of elasticity in the
lungs leads to prolonged times for exhalation, which
occurs through passive recoil of the expanded lung. This
leads to a smaller volume of gas exchanged per breath.
Inflammation
Structural
Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is a rare lung disorder of small stone formation in the
alveoli.
A pulmonary contusion is a bruise of the lung tissue caused by trauma.[33] Damaged capillaries from a
contusion can cause blood and other fluids to accumulate in the tissue of the lung, impairing gas exchange.
Pulmonary edema is the buildup of fluid in the parenchyma and alveoli. An edema is usually caused by left
ventricular heart failure, or by damage to the lung or its vasculature.
Because of the high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in type II alveolar cells, the
lungs are susceptible to infections by some coronaviruses including the viruses that cause severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS)[34] and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).[35]
