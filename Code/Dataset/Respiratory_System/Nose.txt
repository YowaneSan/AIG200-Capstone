Nose
A nose is a protuberance in vertebrates that houses the nostrils,
or nares, which receive and expel air for respiration alongside
the mouth. Behind the nose are the olfactory mucosa and the
sinuses. Behind the nasal cavity, air next passes through the
pharynx, shared with the digestive system, and then into the rest
of the respiratory system. In humans, the nose is located
centrally on the face and serves as an alternative respiratory
passage especially during suckling for infants.[1][2][3] The
protruding nose that is completely separate from the mouth part
is a characteristic found only in therian mammals. It has been
theorized that this unique mammalian nose evolved from the
anterior part of the upper jaw of the reptilian-like ancestors
(synapsids).[4][5]
Acting as the first interface between the external environment
and an animal's delicate internal lungs, a nose conditions
incoming air, both as a function of thermal regulation and
filtration during respiration, as well as enabling the sensory
perception of smell.[6]
Hair inside nostrils filter incoming air, as a first line of defense
against dust particles, smoke, and other potential obstructions
that would otherwise inhibit respiration, and as a kind of filter
against airborne illness. In addition to acting as a filter, mucus
produced within the nose supplements the body's effort to maintain temperature, as well as contributes
moisture to integral components of the respiratory system. Capillary structures of the nose warm and

humidify air entering the body; later, this role in retaining moisture enables conditions for alveoli to properly
exchange O2 for CO2 (i.e., respiration) within the lungs. During exhalation, the capillaries then aid
recovery of some moisture, mostly as a function of thermal regulation, again.[7]
The wet nose of dogs is useful for the perception of direction. The sensitive cold receptors in the skin detect
the place where the nose is cooled the most and this is the direction a particular smell that the animal just
picked up comes from.[8]
In amphibians and lungfish, the nostrils open into small sacs that, in turn,
open into the forward roof of the mouth through the choanae. These sacs
contain a small amount of olfactory epithelium, which, in the case of
caecilians, also lines a number of neighbouring tentacles. Despite the
general similarity in structure to those of amphibians, the nostrils of
lungfish are not used in respiration, since these animals breathe through
their mouths. Amphibians also have a vomeronasal organ, lined by
olfactory epithelium, but, unlike those of amniotes, this is generally a
simple sac that, except in salamanders, has little connection with the rest of
the nasal system.[9]
In reptiles, the nasal chamber is generally larger, with the choanae located much further back in the roof of
the mouth. In crocodilians, the chamber is exceptionally long, helping the animal to breathe while partially
submerged. The reptilian nasal chamber is divided into three parts: an anterior vestibule, the main olfactory
chamber, and a posterior nasopharynx. The olfactory chamber is lined by olfactory epithelium on its upper
surface and possesses a number of turbinates to increase the sensory area. The vomeronasal organ is well-
developed in lizards and snakes, in which it no longer connects with the nasal cavity, opening directly into
the roof of the mouth. It is smaller in turtles, in which it retains its original nasal connection, and is absent in
adult crocodilians.[9]
Birds have a similar nose to reptiles, with the nostrils located at the upper rear part of the beak. Since they
generally have a poor sense of smell, the olfactory chamber is small, although it does contain three
turbinates, which sometimes have a complex structure similar to that of mammals. In many birds, including
doves and fowls, the nostrils are covered by a horny protective shield. The vomeronasal organ of birds is
either under-developed or altogether absent, depending on the species.[9]
The nasal cavities in mammals are both fused into one. Among
most species, they are exceptionally large, typically occupying up to
half the length of the skull. In some groups, however, including
primates, bats, and cetaceans, the nose has been secondarily
reduced, and these animals consequently have a relatively poor
sense of smell. The nasal cavity of mammals has been enlarged, in
part, by the development of a palate cutting off the entire upper
surface of the original oral cavity, which consequently becomes part
of the nose, leaving the palate as the new roof of the mouth. The

enlarged nasal cavity contains complex turbinates forming coiled scroll-like shapes that help to warm the air
before it reaches the lungs. The cavity also extends into neighbouring skull bones, forming additional air
cavities known as paranasal sinuses.[9]
In cetaceans, the nose has been reduced to one or two blowholes, which are the nostrils that have migrated
to the top of the head. This adaptation gave cetaceans a more streamlined body shape and the ability to
breathe while mostly submerged. Conversely, the elephant's nose has elaborated into a long, muscular,
manipulative organ called the trunk.
The vomeronasal organ of mammals is generally similar to that of reptiles. In most species, it is located in
the floor of the nasal cavity, and opens into the mouth via two nasopalatine ducts running through the
palate, but it opens directly into the nose in many rodents. It is, however, lost in bats, and in many primates,
including humans.[9]
Fish have a relatively good sense of smell.[10] Unlike that of tetrapods, the nose has no connection with the
mouth, nor any role in respiration. Instead, it generally consists of a pair of small pouches located behind the
nostrils at the front or sides of the head. In many cases, each of the nostrils is divided into two by a fold of
skin, allowing water to flow into the nose through one side and out through the other.[9]
The pouches are lined by olfactory epithelium, and commonly include a series of internal folds to increase
the surface area, often forming an elaborate "olfactory rosette". In some teleosts, the pouches branch off into
additional sinus-like cavities, while in coelacanths, they form a series of tubes.[9]
In the earliest vertebrates, there was only one nostril and olfactory pouch, and the nasal passage was
connected to the hypophysis. The same anatomy is observed in the most primitive living vertebrates, the
lampreys and hagfish. In gnathostome ancestors, the olfactory apparatus gradually became paired
(presumably to allow sense of direction of smells), and freeing the midline from the nasal passage allowed
evolution of jaws.[11]
