Microscopy of keratin filaments inside cells
Keratin
Keratin (/ˈkɛrətɪn/[1][2]) is one of a family of structural
fibrous proteins also known as scleroproteins. Alpha-
keratin (α-keratin) is a type of keratin found in
vertebrates. It is the key structural material making up
scales, hair, nails, feathers, horns, claws, hooves, and
the outer layer of skin among vertebrates. Keratin also
protects epithelial cells from damage or stress. Keratin
is extremely insoluble in water and organic solvents.
Keratin monomers assemble into bundles to form
intermediate filaments, which are tough and form
strong unmineralized epidermal appendages found in
reptiles, 
birds, 
amphibians, 
and 
mammals.[3][4]
Excessive keratinization participate in fortification of
certain tissues such as in horns of cattle and rhinos, and
armadillos' osteoderm.[5] The only other biological
matter known to approximate the toughness of
keratinized tissue is chitin.[6][7][8] Keratin comes in
two types, the primitive, softer forms found in all vertebrates and harder, derived forms found only among
sauropsids (reptiles and birds).
Spider silk is classified as keratin,[9] although production of the protein may have evolved independently of
the process in vertebrates.
Alpha-keratins (α-keratins) are found in all vertebrates. They form the hair (including wool), the outer layer
of skin, horns, nails, claws and hooves of mammals, and the slime threads of hagfish.[4] The baleen plates
of filter-feeding whales are also made of keratin. Keratin filaments are abundant in keratinocytes in the
hornified layer of the epidermis; these are proteins which have undergone keratinization. They are also
present in epithelial cells in general. For example, mouse thymic epithelial cells react with antibodies for
keratin 5, keratin 8, and keratin 14. These antibodies are used as fluorescent markers to distinguish subsets
of mouse thymic epithelial cells in genetic studies of the thymus.
The harder beta-keratins (β-keratins) are found only in the sauropsids, that is all living reptiles and birds.
They are found in the nails, scales, and claws of reptiles, in some reptile shells (testudines, such as tortoise,
turtle, terrapin), and in the feathers, beaks, and claws of birds.[10] These keratins are formed primarily in
beta sheets. However, beta sheets are also found in α-keratins.[11] Recent scholarship has shown that
sauropsid β-keratins are fundamentally different from α-keratins at a genetic and structural level. The new
term corneous beta protein (CBP) has been proposed to avoid confusion with α-keratins.[12]
Examples of occurrence
The horns of the impala are made of
keratin covering a core of bone.
The neutral–
basic keratins
are encoded
on
chromosome
12 (12q13.13).
The acidic keratins
are encoded on
chromosome 17
(17q21.2).
Keratins (also described as cytokeratins) are polymers of type I and
type II intermediate filaments that have been found only in
chordates (vertebrates, amphioxus, urochordates). Nematodes and
many other non-chordate animals seem to have only type VI
intermediate filaments, fibers that structure the nucleus.
The human genome encodes 54 functional
keratin genes, located in two clusters on
chromosomes 12 and 17. This suggests that they
originated from a series of gene duplications on
these chromosomes.[13]
The keratins include the following proteins of
which KRT23, KRT24, KRT25, KRT26,
KRT27, KRT28, KRT31, KRT32, KRT33A,

KRT78, KRT79, KRT8, KRT80, KRT81,
KRT82, KRT83, KRT84, KRT85 and KRT86 have been
used to describe keratins past 20.[14]

Protein sequence alignment of human keratin 1, 2A, 3,4, 5, 6A, 7, and 8 (KRT1 – KRT8). Only the first rod
domain is shown above. Alignment was created using Clustal Omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustal
o/).
The first sequences of keratins were determined by Israel Hanukoglu and Elaine Fuchs (1982,
1983).[16][17] These sequences revealed that there are two distinct but homologous keratin families, which
were named type I and type II keratins.[17] By analysis of the primary structures of these keratins and other
intermediate filament proteins, Hanukoglu and Fuchs suggested a model in which keratins and intermediate
filament proteins contain a central ~310 residue domain with four segments in α-helical conformation that
are separated by three short linker segments predicted to be in beta-turn conformation.[17] This model has
been confirmed by the determination of the crystal structure of a helical domain of keratins.[18]
The human genome has 54 functional annotated Keratin genes, 28 are in the Keratin type 1 family, and 26
are in the Keratin type 2 family. [19]
Fibrous keratin molecules supercoil to form a very stable, left-handed superhelical motif to multimerise,
forming filaments consisting of multiple copies of the keratin monomer.[20]
Protein structure
Type 1 and 2 Keratins
Keratin (high molecular
weight) in bile duct cell and
oval cells of horse liver.
The major force that keeps the coiled-coil structure is hydrophobic
interactions between apolar residues along the keratins helical
segments.[21]
Limited interior space is the reason why the triple helix of the (unrelated)
structural protein collagen, found in skin, cartilage and bone, likewise has
a high percentage of glycine. The connective tissue protein elastin also has
a high percentage of both glycine and alanine. Silk fibroin, considered a
β-keratin, can have these two as 75–80% of the total, with 10–15% serine,
with the rest having bulky side groups. The chains are antiparallel, with an
alternating C → N orientation.[22] A preponderance of amino acids with
small, nonreactive side groups is characteristic of structural proteins, for
which H-bonded close packing is more important than chemical
specificity.
In addition to intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, the distinguishing feature of keratins is the
presence of large amounts of the sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine, required for the disulfide bridges
that confer additional strength and rigidity by permanent, thermally stable crosslinking[23]—in much the
same way that non-protein sulfur bridges stabilize vulcanized rubber. Human hair is approximately 14%
cysteine. The pungent smells of burning hair and skin are due to the volatile sulfur compounds formed.
Extensive disulfide bonding contributes to the insolubility of keratins, except in a small number of solvents
such as dissociating or reducing agents.
The more flexible and elastic keratins of hair have fewer interchain disulfide bridges than the keratins in
mammalian fingernails, hooves and claws (homologous structures), which are harder and more like their
analogs in other vertebrate classes.[24] Hair and other α-keratins consist of α-helically coiled single protein
strands (with regular intra-chain H-bonding), which are then further twisted into superhelical ropes that may
be further coiled. The β-keratins of reptiles and birds have β-pleated sheets twisted together, then stabilized
and hardened by disulfide bridges.
Thiolated polymers (=thiomers) can form disulfide bridges with cysteine substructures of keratins getting
covalently attached to these proteins.[25] Thiomers exhibit therefore high binding properties to keratins
found in hair,[26] on skin[27][28] and on the surface of many cell types.[29]
It has been proposed that keratins can be divided into 'hard' and 'soft' forms, or 'cytokeratins' and 'other
keratins'. That model is now understood to be correct. A new nuclear addition in 2006 to describe keratins
takes this into account.[14]
Disulfide bridges
Filament formation
Keratin filaments are intermediate filaments. Like all intermediate filaments, keratin proteins form
filamentous polymers in a series of assembly steps beginning with dimerization; dimers assemble into
tetramers and octamers and eventually, if the current hypothesis holds, into unit-length-filaments (ULF)
capable of annealing end-to-end into long filaments.

Cornification is the process of forming an epidermal barrier in stratified squamous epithelial tissue. At the
cellular level, cornification is characterised by:
production of keratin
production of small proline-rich (SPRR) proteins and transglutaminase which eventually
form a cornified cell envelope beneath the plasma membrane
terminal differentiation
loss of nuclei and organelles, in the final stages of cornification
Metabolism ceases, and the cells are almost completely filled by keratin. During the process of epithelial
differentiation, cells become cornified as keratin protein is incorporated into longer keratin intermediate
filaments. Eventually the nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles disappear, metabolism ceases and cells
undergo a programmed death as they become fully keratinized. In many other cell types, such as cells of the
dermis, keratin filaments and other intermediate filaments function as part of the cytoskeleton to
mechanically stabilize the cell against physical stress. It does this through connections to desmosomes, cell–
cell junctional plaques, and hemidesmosomes, cell-basement membrane adhesive structures.
Cells in the epidermis contain a structural matrix of keratin, which makes this outermost layer of the skin
almost waterproof, and along with collagen and elastin gives skin its strength. Rubbing and pressure cause
thickening of the outer, cornified layer of the epidermis and form protective calluses, which are useful for
athletes and on the fingertips of musicians who play stringed instruments. Keratinized epidermal cells are
constantly shed and replaced.
These hard, integumentary structures are formed by intercellular cementing of fibers formed from the dead,
cornified cells generated by specialized beds deep within the skin. Hair grows continuously and feathers
molt and regenerate. The constituent proteins may be phylogenetically homologous but differ somewhat in
Pairing
Cornification
chemical structure and supermolecular organization. The evolutionary relationships are complex and only
partially known. Multiple genes have been identified for the β-keratins in feathers, and this is probably
characteristic of all keratins.
The silk fibroins produced by insects and spiders are often classified as keratins, though it is unclear
whether they are phylogenetically related to vertebrate keratins.
Silk found in insect pupae, and in spider webs and egg casings, also has twisted β-pleated sheets
incorporated into fibers wound into larger supermolecular aggregates. The structure of the spinnerets on
spiders’ tails, and the contributions of their interior glands, provide remarkable control of fast extrusion.
Spider silk is typically about 1 to 2 micrometers (μm) thick, compared with about 60 μm for human hair,
and more for some mammals. The biologically and commercially useful properties of silk fibers depend on
the organization of multiple adjacent protein chains into hard, crystalline regions of varying size, alternating
with flexible, amorphous regions where the chains are randomly coiled.[30] A somewhat analogous situation
occurs with synthetic polymers such as nylon, developed as a silk substitute. Silk from the hornet cocoon
contains doublets about 10 μm across, with cores and coating, and may be arranged in up to 10 layers, also
in plaques of variable shape. Adult hornets also use silk as a glue, as do spiders.
Glues made from partially-hydrolysed keratin include hoof glue and horn glue.
Abnormal growth of keratin can occur in a variety of conditions including keratosis, hyperkeratosis and
keratoderma.
Mutations in keratin gene expression can lead to, among others:
Alopecia Areata
Epidermolysis bullosa simplex
Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens
Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis
Steatocystoma multiplex
Keratosis pharyngis
Rhabdoid cell formation in Large cell lung carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype[31][32]
Several diseases, such as athlete's foot and ringworm, are caused by infectious fungi that feed on keratin.[33]
Keratin is highly resistant to digestive acids if ingested. Cats regularly ingest hair as part of their grooming
behavior, leading to the gradual formation of hairballs that may be expelled orally or excreted. In humans,
trichophagia may lead to Rapunzel syndrome, an extremely rare but potentially fatal intestinal condition.

Clinical significance
Diagnostic use
Keratin expression is helpful in determining epithelial origin in anaplastic cancers. Tumors that express
keratin include carcinomas, thymomas, sarcomas and trophoblastic neoplasms. Furthermore, the precise
expression-pattern of keratin subtypes allows prediction of the origin of the primary tumor when assessing
metastases. For example, hepatocellular carcinomas typically express CK8 and CK18, and
cholangiocarcinomas express CK7, CK8 and CK18, while metastases of colorectal carcinomas express
CK20, but not CK7.[34]
