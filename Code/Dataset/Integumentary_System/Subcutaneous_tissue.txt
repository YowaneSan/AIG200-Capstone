Subcutaneous tissue
The subcutaneous tissue (from Latin subcutaneous  'beneath
the skin'), also called the hypodermis, hypoderm (from
Greek 'beneath the skin'), subcutis, or superficial fascia,[2] is
the lowermost layer of the integumentary system in
vertebrates.[3] The types of cells found in the layer are
fibroblasts, adipose cells, and macrophages. The subcutaneous
tissue is derived from the mesoderm, but unlike the dermis, it is
not derived from the mesoderm's dermatome region. It consists
primarily of loose connective tissue, and contains larger blood
vessels and nerves than those found in the dermis. It is a major
site of fat storage in the body.
In arthropods, a hypodermis can refer to an epidermal layer of
cells that secretes the chitinous cuticle. The term also refers to a
layer of cells lying immediately below the epidermis of plants.
Fibrous bands anchoring the skin to the deep
fascia[4]
Collagen and elastin fibers attaching it to the
dermis[5]
Fat is absent from the eyelids, clitoris, penis, much of
pinna, and scrotum[1]
Blood vessels on route to the dermis[6]
Lymphatic vessels on route from the dermis[7]
The glandular part of some sweat glands; mammary
glands lie entirely within the subcutaneous tissue[8]
(which are modified apocrine sweat glands)[9]
Cutaneous nerves[7] and free endings
Hair follicle roots

 and Pacinian corpuscles
Mast cells[11]
Bursae, in the space overlying joints in order to
facilitate smooth passage of overlying skin
Fine, flat sheets of muscle, in certain locations,
including the scalp, face, hand, nipple, and scrotum,
called the panniculus carnosus
In some animals, such as whales and hibernating mammals, the
hypodermis forms an important insulating layer and/or food
store.

Anatomical terminology
Cross-sections of the torso of a
person of normal weight (left) and an
obese person (right), taken by CT
scan. Note the 3.6 cm (1.4 inches) of
subcutaneous fat on the obese
person.
In some plants, the hypodermis is a layer of cells immediately
below the epidermis of leaves. It is often mechanically
strengthened, for example, in pine leaves, forming an extra protective layer or a water storage tissue.
Subcutaneous fat is the layer of subcutaneous tissue that is most
widely distributed.[1] It is composed of adipocytes, which are
grouped together in lobules separated by connective tissue.[5] The
number of adipocytes varies among different areas of the body,
while their size varies according to the body's nutritional state.[12] It
acts as padding and as an energy reserve, as well as providing some
minor thermoregulation via insulation.[10][5] Subcutaneous fat is
found just beneath the skin, as opposed to visceral fat, which is
found in the peritoneal cavity,[13] and can be measured using body
fat calipers to give a rough estimate of total body adiposity.[14]
Injection into the subcutaneous tissue is a route of administration used for drugs such as insulin: because it
possesses few blood vessels, the tissue absorbs drugs slowly.[10]: 
135  Subcutaneous injection is believed to
be the most effective manner to administer some drugs, such as human growth hormones. Just as the
subcutaneous tissue can store fat, it can also provide good storage space for drugs that need to be released
gradually because there is limited blood flow. "Skin popping" is a slang term that includes this method of
administration, and is usually used in association with recreational drugs.
