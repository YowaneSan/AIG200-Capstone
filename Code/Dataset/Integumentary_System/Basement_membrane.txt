Basement membrane
The basement membrane, also known as base membrane, is a
thin, pliable sheet-like type of extracellular matrix that provides
cell and tissue support and acts as a platform for complex
signalling.[1][2] The basement membrane sits between epithelial
tissues including mesothelium and endothelium, and the
underlying connective tissue.[3][4]
As seen with the electron microscope, the basement membrane
is composed of two layers, the basal lamina and the reticular
lamina.[4] The underlying connective tissue attaches to the basal
lamina with collagen VII anchoring fibrils and fibrillin
microfibrils.[5]
The basal lamina layer can further be subdivided into two
layers based on their visual appearance in electron microscopy.
The lighter-colored layer closer to the epithelium is called the
lamina lucida, while the denser-colored layer closer to the
connective tissue is called the lamina densa. The electron-dense
lamina densa layer is about 30–70 nanometers thick and
consists of an underlying network of reticular collagen IV
fibrils which average 30 nanometers in diameter and 0.1–2
micrometers in thickness and are coated with the heparan
sulfate-rich proteoglycan perlecan.[6] In addition to collagen,
this supportive matrix contains intrinsic macromolecular
components. The lamina lucida layer is made up of laminin,
integrins, entactins, and dystroglycans. Integrins are a key
component of hemidesmosomes which serve to anchor the
epithelium to the underlying basement membrane.
To represent the above in a visually organised manner, the
basement membrane is organized as follows:

Connective tissue (Lamina propria)
The primary function of the basement membrane is to anchor down
the epithelium to its loose connective tissue (the dermis or lamina
propria) underneath. This is achieved by cell-matrix adhesions
through substrate adhesion molecules (SAMs).
The basement membrane acts as a mechanical barrier, preventing
malignant cells from invading the deeper tissues.[7] Early stages of
malignancy that are thus limited to the epithelial layer by the
basement membrane are called carcinoma in situ.
The basement membrane is also essential for angiogenesis
(development of new blood vessels). Basement membrane proteins
have been found to accelerate differentiation of endothelial cells.[8]
The most notable examples of basement membranes is the
glomerular basement membrane of the kidney, by the fusion of the
basal lamina from the endothelium of glomerular capillaries and the podocyte basal lamina,[9] and between
lung alveoli and pulmonary capillaries, by the fusion of the basal lamina of the lung alveoli and of the basal
lamina of the lung capillaries, which is where oxygen and CO2 diffusion occurs (gas exchange).
As of 2017, other roles for basement membrane include blood filtration and muscle homeostasis.[1]
Fractones may be a type of basement membrane, serving as a niche for stem cells.[10][11]
Some diseases result from a poorly functioning basement membrane. The cause can be genetic defects,
injuries by the body's own immune system, or other mechanisms.[12] Diseases involving basement
membranes at multiple locations include:
Genetic defects in the collagen fibers of the basement membrane, including Alport syndrome
and Knobloch syndrome
Autoimmune diseases targeting basement membranes. Non-collagenous domain basement
membrane collagen type IV is autoantigen (target antigen) of autoantibodies in the
Function
Clinical significance
autoimmune disease Goodpasture's syndrome.[13]
A group of diseases stemming from improper function of basement membrane zone are
united under the name epidermolysis bullosa.[14]
In histopathology, thickened basement membranes are found in several inflammatory diseases, such as
lichen sclerosus, systemic lupus erythematosus or dermatomyositis in the skin, or collagenous colitis in the
colon.[15]
These are only found within diploblastic and homoscleromorphic sponge animals. The homoscleromorph
were found to be sister to diploblasts in some studies, making the membrane originate once in the history of
life. But more recent studies have disregarded diploblast-homoscleromorph group, so other sponges may
have lost it (most probable) or the origin in the two groups may be separate.
