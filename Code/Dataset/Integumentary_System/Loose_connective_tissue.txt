Anatomical terminology
Loose connective tissue
Loose connective tissue, also known as areolar tissue, is a
cellular connective tissue with thin and relatively sparse
collagen fibers. They have a semi-fluid matrix with lesser
proportions of fibers. Its ground substance occupies more
volume than the fibers do. It has a viscous to gel-like
consistency and plays an important role in the diffusion of
oxygen and nutrients from the capillaries that course through
this connective tissue as well as in the diffusion of carbon
dioxide and metabolic wastes back to the vessels. Moreover,
loose connective tissue is primarily located beneath the epithelia
that cover the body surfaces and line the internal surfaces of the
body. It is also associated with the epithelium of glands and
surrounds the smallest blood vessels. This tissue is thus the
initial site where pathogenic agents, such as bacteria that have
breached an epithelial surface, are challenged and destroyed by
cells of the immune system.[1]
In the past, the designations areolar tissue, adipose tissue, and
reticular tissue have been listed as subsets of loose connective
tissue. However, they are no longer considered subsets of loose
connective tissue. Loose connective tissue is a subset of
connective tissue proper. Furthermore, areolar tissue is the same
as loose connective tissue, adipose tissue is a subset of
specialized connective tissue, and reticular tissue is the presence
of reticular fibers and reticular cells together forming the stroma
of hemopoietic tissue (specifically the red bone marrow) and
lymphatic tissue organs (lymph nodes and spleen but not the
thymus).[1]
Most cell types in loose connective tissue are transient
wandering cells that migrate from local blood vessels in
response to specific stimuli. Loose connective tissue, therefore,
is a site of inflammatory and immune reactions. In areas of the
body where foreign substances are continually present, large
populations of immune cells are maintained. For example, the

lamina propria, the loose connective tissue of mucous membranes, such as those of the respiratory and
alimentary systems, contains large numbers of these cells.[1]
It is a pliable, mesh-like tissue with a fluid matrix and functions to
cushion and protect body organs.
Fibroblasts are widely dispersed in this tissue; they are irregular
branching cells that secrete strong fibrous proteins and
proteoglycans as an extracellular matrix.
The cells of this type of tissue are generally connected by a
gelatinous substance known as ground substance primarily made up
of collagenous and elastic fibers.
It may be found in tissue sections from almost every part of the body. It surrounds blood vessels and nerves
and penetrates with them even into the small spaces of muscles, tendons, and other tissues. It may likewise
be present in the mediastinal extremities. Nearly every epithelium rests on a layer of areolar tissue, whose
blood vessels provide the epithelium with nutrition, waste removal, and a ready supply of infection-fighting
leukocytes when needed. Because of the abundance of open, fluid-filled space, leukocytes can move about
freely in areolar tissue and can easily find and destroy pathogens.
The areolar tissue is found beneath the epidermis layer and is also underneath the epithelial tissue of all the
body systems that have external openings. it makes the skin elastic and helps it to withstand pulling pain. It
is also a component of the lamina propria of the digestive and respiratory tracts, the mucous membranes of
reproductive and urinary systems, the stroma of glands, and the hypodermis of the skin. It is also found in
the mesentery which is surrounding the intestine.
Loose connective tissue is named based on the "weave" and type of its constituent fibers. There are three
main types:
Collagenous fibers: collagenous fibers are made of collagen and consist of bundles of fibrils
that are coils of collagen molecules.
Elastic fibers: elastic fibers are made of elastin and are "stretchable."
Reticular fibers: reticular fibers consist of one or more types of very thin collagen fibers. They
join connective tissues to other tissues.

Areolar tissue
Areolar tissue (/əˈriːələr/ or /ˌɛəriˈoʊlər, ˌær-/[2][3]) is a common type of loose connective tissue (and the
most widely distributed type of connective tissue in vertebrates). It is so-named because its fibers are far
enough apart to leave ample open space for interstitial fluid in between (areola is Latin for a "little open
space"). It is strong enough to bind different tissue types together, yet soft enough to provide flexibility and
cushioning. It exhibits interlacing,[4] loosely organized fibers, abundant blood vessels, and significant empty
space filled with interstitial fluid. Many adjacent epithelial tissues (which are avascular) get their nutrients
from the interstitial fluid of areolar tissue; the lamina propria is areolar in many body locations. Its fibers run
in random directions and are mostly collagenous, but elastic and reticular fibers are also present. Areolar
tissue is highly variable in appearance. In many serous membranes, it appears as a loose arrangement of
collagenous and elastic fibers, scattered cells of various types; abundant ground substance; numerous blood
vessels. In the skin and mucous membranes, it is more compact and sometimes difficult to distinguish from
dense irregular connective tissue.
Areolar connective tissue holds organs in place and attaches epithelial tissue to other underlying tissues. It
also serves as a reservoir of water and salts for surrounding tissues. Almost all cells obtain their nutrients
from and release their wastes into areolar connective tissue.
Organs that are rich in loose connective tissue (such as the eyelids) are usually sites that undergo oedema,
indicating kidney failure or nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, periorbital swelling is one characteristic finding
in severe kidney disease.
