Anatomical terms of microanatomy
Melanocyte
Melanocytes are melanin-producing neural crest-derived[3]
cells located in the bottom layer (the stratum basale) of the
skin's epidermis, the middle layer of the eye (the uvea),[4] the
inner ear,[5] vaginal epithelium,[6] meninges,[7] bones,[8] and
heart.[9] Melanin is a dark pigment primarily responsible for
skin color. Once synthesized, melanin is contained in special
organelles called melanosomes which can be transported to
nearby keratinocytes to induce pigmentation. Thus darker skin
tones have more melanosomes present than lighter skin tones.
Functionally, melanin serves as protection against UV radiation.
Melanocytes also have a role in the immune system.
Through a process called melanogenesis, melanocytes produce
melanin, which is a pigment found in the skin, eyes, hair, nasal
cavity, and inner ear. This melanogenesis leads to a long-lasting
pigmentation, which is in contrast to the pigmentation that
originates from oxidation of already-existing melanin.
There are both basal and activated levels of melanogenesis; in
general, lighter-skinned people have low basal levels of
melanogenesis. Exposure to UV-B radiation causes increased
melanogenesis. The purpose of melanogenesis is to protect the
hypodermis, the layer under the skin, from damage by UV
radiation. The color of the melanin is black, allowing it to
absorb a majority of the UV light and block it from passing
through the epidermis.[10]
Since the action spectrum of sunburn and melanogenesis are
virtually identical, they are assumed to be induced by the same
mechanism.[11] The agreement of the action spectrum with the
absorption spectrum of DNA points towards the formation of
cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) - direct DNA damage.
Typically, between 1000 and 2000 melanocytes are found per
square millimeter of skin or approximately 5% to 10% of the
cells in the basal layer of epidermis. Although their size can
vary, melanocytes are typically 7 μm in length.
Both lightly and darkly pigmented skin contain similar numbers
of melanocytes,[12] with difference in skin color due to differences the packing of eumelanin into the
melanosomes of keratinocytes: those in dark-toned skin are "packaged into peri-nuclear distributed,

ellipsoid" melanosomes while those light-tone skin are "assembled
into clustered small, circular melanosomes".[13] There are also
differences in the quantity and relative amounts of eumelanin and
pheomelanin.[13] Pigmentation including tanning is under hormonal
control, including the MSH and ACTH peptides that are produced
from the precursor proopiomelanocortin.
Vitiligo is a skin disease where people lack melanin in certain areas
in the skin.
People with oculocutaneous albinism typically have a very low
level of melanin production. Albinism is often but not always
related to the TYR gene coding the tyrosinase enzyme. Tyrosinase is
required for melanocytes to produce melanin from the amino acid
tyrosine.[14] Albinism may be caused by a number of other genes as
well, like OCA2,[15] SLC45A2,[16] TYRP1,[17] and HPS1[18] to
name some. In all, already 17 types of oculocutaneous albinism
have been recognized.[19] Each gene is related to different protein
having a role in pigment production.
People with Chédiak–Higashi syndrome have a buildup of melanin
granules due to abnormal function of microtubules.
In addition to their role as UV radical scavengers, melanocytes are also part of the immune system, and are
considered to be immune cells.[20] Although the full role of melanocytes in immune response is not fully
understood, melanocytes share many characteristics with dendritic cells: branched morphology; phagocytic
capabilities; presentation of antigens to T-cells; and production and release of cytokines.[20][21][22]
Although melanocytes are dendritic in form and share many characteristics with dendritic cells, they derive
from different cell lineages. Dendritic cells are derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.
Melanocytes on the other hand originate from neural crest cells. As such, although morphologically and
functionally similar, melanocytes and dendritic cells are not the same.
Melanocytes are capable of expressing MHC Class II,[21] a type of MHC expressed only by certain antigen
presenting cells of the immune system, when stimulated by interactions with antigen or cytokines. All cells
in any given vertebrate express MHC, but most cells only express MHC class I. The other class of MHC,
Class II, is found only on "professional" antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, B
cells, and melanocytes. Importantly, melanocytes stimulated by cytokines express surface proteins such as
CD40 and ICAM1 in addition to MHC class II, allowing for co-stimulation of T cells.[20]
In addition to presenting antigen, one of the roles of melanocytes in the immune response is cytokine
production.[23] Melanocytes express many proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, IL-8,
TNF-α, and TGF-β.[20][21] Like other immune cells, melanocytes secrete these cytokines in response to
activation of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) such as Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) which recognize
MAMPs. MAMPs, also known as PAMPs, are microbial associated molecular patterns, small molecular
elements such as proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids present on or in a given pathogen. In addition, cytokine
production by melanocytes can be triggered by cytokines secreted by other nearby immune cells.[20]
Role in the immune system
Melanocytes are ideally positioned in the epidermis to be sentinels against harmful pathogens. Melanocytes
reside in the stratum basale,[23] the lowest layer of the epidermis, but they use their dendrites to interact with
cells in other layers,[24] and to capture pathogens that enter the epidermis.[21] Melanocytes likely work in
concert with both keratinocytes and Langerhans cells,[20][21] both of which are also actively phagocytic,[23]
to contribute to the immune response.
Tyrosine is the non-essential amino acid precursor of melanin. Tyrosine is converted to
dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) via the enzyme tyrosinase. Then DOPA is polymerized into melanin. The
copper-ion based enzyme-catalyzed oxidative transformation of catechol derivative dopa to light absorbing
dopaquinone to indole-5,6-quinone is clearly seen following the polymerization to melanin, the color of the
pigment ranges from red to dark brown.
Numerous stimuli are able to alter melanogenesis, or the production of melanin by cultured melanocytes,
although the method by which it works is not fully understood. Increased melanin production is seen in
conditions where adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is elevated, such as Addison's and Cushing's
disease. This is mainly a consequence of alpha-MSH being secreted along with the hormone associated
with reproductive tendencies in primates. Alpha-MSH is a cleavage product of ACTH that has an equal
affinity for the MC1 receptor on melanocytes as ACTH.[25]
Melanosomes are vesicles that package the chemical inside a plasma membrane. The melanosomes are
organized as a cap protecting the nucleus of the keratinocyte. When ultraviolet rays penetrate the skin and
damage DNA, thymidine dinucleotide (pTpT) fragments from damaged DNA will trigger
melanogenesis[26] and cause the melanocyte to produce melanosomes, which are then transferred by
dendrites to the top layer of keratinocytes.
The precursor of the melanocyte is the melanoblast. In adults, stem cells are contained in the bulge area of
the outer root sheath of hair follicles. When a hair is lost and the hair follicle regenerates, the stem cells are
activated. These stem cells develop into both keratinocyte precursors and melanoblasts - and these
melanoblasts supply both hair and skin (moving into the basal layer of the epidermis). There is additionally
evidence that melanocyte stem cells are present in cutaneous nerves, with nerve signals causing these cells
to differentiate into melanocytes for the skin.[27]
