Dermis
The dermis or corium is a layer of skin between the epidermis
(with which it makes up the cutis) and subcutaneous tissues,
that primarily consists of dense irregular connective tissue and
cushions the body from stress and strain. It is divided into two
layers, the superficial area adjacent to the epidermis called the
papillary region and a deep thicker area known as the reticular
dermis.[1] The dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis
through a basement membrane. Structural components of the
dermis are collagen, elastic fibers, and extrafibrillar matrix.[2] It
also contains mechanoreceptors that provide the sense of touch
and thermoreceptors that provide the sense of heat. In addition,
hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands (oil glands),
apocrine glands, lymphatic vessels, nerves and blood vessels
are present in the dermis. Those blood vessels provide
nourishment and waste removal for both dermal and epidermal
cells.
The dermis is composed of three major types of cells:[3]
fibroblasts, macrophages, and mast cells.
Apart from these cells, the dermis is also composed of matrix
components such as collagen (which provides strength), elastin
(which provides elasticity), and extrafibrillar matrix, an
extracellular gel-like substance primarily composed of
glycosaminoglycans (most notably hyaluronan), proteoglycans,
and glycoproteins.[3]
The papillary dermis is the uppermost layer of the dermis. It
intertwines with the rete ridges of the epidermis and is
composed of fine and loosely arranged collagen fibers.[2] The
papillary region is composed of loose areolar connective tissue.
It is named for its fingerlike projections called papillae or
dermal papillae specifically, that extend toward the epidermis
and contain either terminal networks of blood capillaries or
tactile Meissner's corpuscles.[4]

and reticular dermis.
The dermal papillae (DP) (singular papilla, diminutive of Latin
papula, 'pimple') are small, nipple-like extensions (or
interdigitations) of the dermis into the epidermis. At the surface
of the skin in hands and feet, they appear as epidermal,
papillary or friction ridges (colloquially known as fingerprints).
Blood vessels in the dermal papillae nourish all hair follicles
and bring nutrients and oxygen to the lower layers of
epidermal cells. The pattern of ridges produced in hands and
feet are partly genetically determined features that are
developed before birth. They remain substantially unaltered
(except in size) throughout life, and therefore determine the
patterns of fingerprints, making them useful in certain functions
of personal identification.[5]
The dermal papillae are part of the uppermost layer of the
dermis, the papillary dermis, and the ridges they form greatly
increase the surface area between the dermis and epidermis.
Because the main function of the dermis is to support the
epidermis, this greatly increases the exchange of oxygen,
nutrients, and waste products between these two layers.
Additionally, the increase in the surface area prevents the
dermal and epidermal layers from separating by strengthening
the junction between them. With age, the papillae tend to flatten
and sometimes increase in number.[6]
The skin of the hands and fingers and the feet and toes is
known by forensic scientists as friction ridge skin. It is known
by anatomists as thick skin, volar skin or hairless skin. It has
raised ridges, a thicker and more complex epidermis, increased
sensory abilities, and the absence of hair and sebaceous glands.
The ridges increase friction for improved grasping.[7]

Anatomical terminology
Dermal papillae also play a pivotal role in hair formation,
growth and cycling.[8]
In mucous membranes, the equivalent structures to dermal
papillae are generally termed "connective tissue papillae",
which interdigitate with the rete pegs of the superficial
epithelium. Dermal papillae are less pronounced in thin skin
areas.
The reticular dermis is the lower layer of the dermis, found
under the papillary dermis, composed of dense irregular
connective tissue featuring densely-packed collagen fibers. It is
the primary location of dermal elastic fibers.[2]
The reticular region is usually much thicker than the overlying
papillary dermis. It receives its name from the dense
concentration of collagenous, elastic, and reticular fibers that
weave throughout it. These protein fibers give the dermis its
properties of strength, extensibility, and elasticity. Within the
reticular region are the roots of the hair, sebaceous glands,
sweat glands, receptors, nails, and blood vessels. The
orientation of collagen fibers within the reticular dermis creates
lines of tension called Langer's lines, which are of some
relevance in surgery and wound healing.[9]
