    "Cognitive Processes: The brain is responsible for all aspects of mental processing, including reasoning, decision-making, learning, and memory. It allows you to solve problems, plan ahead, and recall past events.\n",

    "Motor Control: It directs voluntary movements by sending signals to muscles. This allows you to perform all sorts of activities like walking, talking, and writing.\n",

    "Sensory Processing: It interprets information from your senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell), allowing you to perceive and interact with the world around you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulation of Bodily Functions: The brain controls many involuntary functions such as heart rate, breathing, and digestion through the autonomic nervous system.\n",

    "Nutrient Absorption: It is the main site for absorbing nutrients like vitamins, minerals, proteins, and carbohydrates into the bloodstream.\n",
    "Structure: It has three parts: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The inner walls are lined with tiny, finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption.\n",
    "Large Intestine (Colon)\n",
    "Water Absorption: The large intestine absorbs water and salts from the remaining indigestible food matter.\n",
    "Formation of Stool: It compacts the waste into stool.\n",
    "Bacterial Flora: The colon contains beneficial bacteria that help break down remaining nutrients and produce certain vitamins like vitamin K.\n",
